Fermionic Gaussian States: practical numerical simulations

This document is meant to be a practical introduction to the manipulation of Fermionic Gaussian systems with your hands or using a Julia package called F_utilities. Starting from the basics, we move to relevant modern results and techiques, and finish introducing novel algorithms. Reading this document the reader should be able to make good use of F_utilities for relevant numerical simulations.

## The PDF file can be found in the folder FINAL PDF.
