  abstract = {The familiar unrestricted Hartree-Fock variational principles is generalized to include quasi-free states. As we show, these are in one-to-one correspondence with the one-particle density matrices and these, in turn, provide a convenient formulation of a generalized Hartree-Fock variational principle, which includes the BCS theory as a special case. While this generalization is not new, it is not well known and we begin by elucidating it. The Hubbard model, with its particle-hole symmetry, is well suited to exploring this theory because BCS states for the attractive model turn into usual HF states for the repulsive model. We rigorously determine the true, unrestricted minimizers for zero and for nonzero temperature in several cases, notably the half-filled band. For the cases treated here, we can exactly determine all broken and unbroken spatial and gauge symmetries of the Hamiltonian.},

The entanglement contour provides a complementary, more re?fined approach to characterizing entanglement than just considering the entanglement entropy between A and B, with several concrete advantages. We illustrate this in the context of ground states and quantum quenches in fermionic quadratic systems. For instance, in a quantum critical system in \$D = 1\$ spatial dimensions, the entanglement contour allows us to determine the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory from just a single partition of the system into regions A and B, (using the entanglement entropy for the same task requires considering several partitions). In \$D \textbackslash{}backslashgeq 2\$ dimensions, the entanglement contour can distinguish between gapped and gapless phases that obey a same boundary law for entanglement entropy. During a local or global quantum quench, the time-dependent contour provides a detailed account of the dynamics of entanglement, including propagating entanglement waves, which offers a microscopic explanation of the behavior of the entanglement entropy as a function of time.},

We show that beyond a noise rate of 89\% on this ancilla the quantum computation can be efficiently simulated classically: we explicitly show that the noisy ancilla is a convex mixture of Gaussian fermionic states in this region, while for noise rates below 53\% we prove that the state is not a mixture of Gaussian states. These results were obtained by generalizing concepts in entanglement theory to the setting of Gaussian states and their convex mixtures. In particular we develop a complete set of criteria, namely the existence of a Gaussian-symmetric extension, which determine whether a state is a convex mixture of Gaussian states.},

  title = {Comment on '{{Reasonable}} Fermionic Quantum Information Theories Require Relativity'},
  author = {Johansson, Markus},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {In [N. Friis, New J. Phys. 18, 033014 (2016)] the non-relativistic description of fermions is considered and in particular the role of the parity superselection rule in relation to the characterization of entanglement. An argument based on the spin-statistics connection is presented as a physical motivation for the parity superselec-tion rule. Since the spin statistics connection was derived in the context of relativistic quantum mechanics it is argued that the inclusion of the parity superselection rule is motivated by Lorentz invariance. Based on this it is further argued that fermionic Quantum Information theory and the theory of special relativity are conceptually inseparable. In this comment a different, and well known, motivation for the parity superselection rule is given that does not rely on arguments from relativistic quantum mechanics, but instead uses the assumptions that the laws of physics are the same for different observers and the no-signalling principle. Fermions exist naturally in the context of relativistic quan-tum mechanics as solutions to the relativistic Dirac equation [1]. It therefore makes sense to understand the properties of fermionic systems in a relativistic context. However, non-relativistic descriptions of fermions are commonly used in cir-cumstances where relativistic effects are negligible. A necessary property of the description of fermions is that there cannot exist a coherent superposition of an even and odd number of fermions. This restriction is called the parity su-perselection rule [2, 3]. Historically it was first formalised by Wick, Wightman, and Wigner [2] and is necessary for the consistency of relativistic quantum theory, i.e., it is a conse-quence of the postulates of quantum mechanics in conjunc-tion with the principles of special relativity (See e.g. Ref. [4]). One way to motivate the parity superselection rule (SSR) is via the spin-statistics connection [5\textendash{}7]. The spin statistics connection makes use of Lorentz invariance and implies that fermions have half-integer spin. The transformation proper-ties of spinors then imply that a coherent superposition of an even and an odd number of fermions is not invariant under a 2{$\pi$} spatial rotation of the system [3]. From the above argument one may be led to believe that the Lorentz invariance of special relativity is a crucial assumption that is needed to motivate the parity SSR. However, in a non-relativistic context the parity SSR can also be derived from the assumption that the laws of physics are the same to all dif-ferent observers and the microcausality principle. In the non-relativistic setting the microcausality principle (See e.g. Refs. [8, 9]) states that simultaneous physical operations in disjoint regions of space commute. If the Hilbert space of the the-ory is separable, i.e., if it has a countable orthonormal basis, the microcausality principle is equivalent to the no-signalling principle [10]. The no-signalling principle states that an ob-server can not instantly change the outcome statistics of an experiment performed by another distant observer. Separability of the Hilbert space of a quantum system is a part of the postulates of quantum mechanics as formulated by Dirac [1] and von Neumann [11]. In particular, the Hilbert space of n fermionic modes, considered in Ref. [12], is sepa-rable for any natural number n. Therefore, no-signalling and microcausality are equivalent in this context. The equivalence of the microcausality principle and the no-signalling principle, for separable Hilbert spaces, can be un-derstood in the following way. If an observable O A of an observer A does not commute with an observable O B of ob-server B it follows that O A and O B do not have a common basis of eigenstates. Thus, at least one eigenspace S of O A has no basis that is a set of eigenstates of O B . Therefore, there exist an eigenstate |{$\psi$} A {$\in$} S which has a nonzero pro-jection onto an eigenvector |{$\psi$} B of O B which does not be-long to S. If A and B prepare the state of their shared system to be |{$\psi$} A , it follows that A would find the measurement out-come corresponding to S with certainty upon performing the measurement. However, if B performs the measurement cor-responding to O B the state of the system will be reduced to an eigenstate of O B and by assumption there is thus a nonzero probability that it is reduced to |{$\psi$} B which is not in S. There-fore, if B performs the measurement before A the measure-ment statistics of A changes and A does no longer see the outcome corresponding to S with certainty. Thus, B can in-stantly change the outcome statistics of A by performing a measurement. If on the other hand [O A , O B ] = 0 it follows that O A and O B have a common eigenbasis and therefore ev-ery eigenspace of O A has a basis of eigenstates of O B . Then B cannot change the outcome statistics of A. To understand the role of the no-signalling principle and the principle that the laws of physics are the same to different ob-servers in the non-relativistic description of fermions we first review the defining properties of non-relativistic fermionic quantum theory. In such a theory all operators can be de-scribed as algebraic combinations of the creation and annihi-lation operators, a},

Specifically, we show how one can determine the covariance matrix corresponding to the fermionic Gaussian state that optimally approximates the quantum state of fermions. The methods apply to relatively large systems, because their complexity only scales quadratically with the number of lattice sites. Moreover, they are specially suited to describe inhomogeneous systems, as those typically found in recent experiments with atoms in optical lattices, at least in the weak interaction regime. As a benchmark, we have applied them to the two-dimensional Hubbard model on a 10\texttimes{}10 lattice with and without external confinement.},

  abstract = {Two genuinely quantum mechanical models for an antiferromagnetic linear chain with nearest neighbor interactions are constructed and solved exactly, in the sense that the ground state, all the elementary excitations and the free energy are found. A general formalism for calculating the instantaneous correlation between any two spins is developed and applied to the investigation of short- and long-range order. Both models show nonvanishing long-range order in the ground state for a range of values of a certain parameter {$\lambda$} which is analogous to an anisotropy parameter in the Heisenberg model. A detailed comparison with the Heisenberg model suggests that the latter has no long-range order in the isotropic case but finite long-range order for any finite amount of anisotropy. The unreliability of variational methods for determining long-range order is emphasized. It is also shown that for spin 12 systems having rather general isotropic Heisenberg interactions favoring an antiferromagnetic ordering, the ground state is nondegenerate and there is no energy gap above the ground state in the energy spectrum of the total system.},

Two interesting examples are the free fermion gas in the harmonic trap and the inhomogeneous XX spin chain called rainbow chain. For conformal field theories defined on static curved spacetimes characterised by a metric which is Weyl equivalent to the flat metric, with the Weyl factor depending only on the spatial coordinate, we study the entanglement hamiltonian and the entanglement spectrum of an interval adjacent to the boundary of a segment where the same boundary condition is imposed at the endpoints. A contour function for the entanglement entropies corresponding to this configuration is also considered, being closely related to the entanglement hamiltonian. The analytic expressions obtained by considering the curved spacetime which characterises the rainbow model have been checked against numerical data for the rainbow chain, finding an excellent agreement.},

  month = feb,
  abstract = {We carry out a comprehensive comparison between the exact modular Hamiltonian and the lattice version of the Bisognano-Wichmann (BW) one in one-dimensional critical quantum spin chains. As a warm-up, we first illustrate how the trace distance provides a more informative mean of comparison between reduced density matrices when compared to any other Schatten \$n\$-distance, normalized or not. In particular, as noticed in earlier works, it provides a way to bound other correlation functions in a precise manner, i.e., providing both lower and upper bounds. Additionally, we show that two close reduced density matrices, i.e. with zero trace distance for large sizes, can have very different modular Hamiltonians. This means that, in terms of describing how two states are close to each other, it is more informative to compare their reduced density matrices rather than the corresponding modular Hamiltonians. After setting this framework, we consider the ground states for infinite and periodic XX spin chain and critical Ising chain. We provide robust numerical evidence that the trace distance between the lattice BW reduced density matrix and the exact one goes to zero as \$\textbackslash{}ell\^\{-2\}\$ for large length of the interval \$\textbackslash{}ell\$. This provides strong constraints on the difference between the corresponding entanglement entropies and correlation functions. Our results indicate that discretized BW reduced density matrices reproduce exact entanglement entropies and correlation functions of local operators in the limit of large subsystem sizes. Finally, we show that the BW reduced density matrices fall short of reproducing the exact behavior of the logarithmic emptiness formation probability in the ground state of the XX spin chain.},
