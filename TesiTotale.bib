	abstract = {Matrix-product states have become the de facto standard for the representation of one-dimensional quantum many body states. During the last few years, numerous new methods have been introduced to evaluate the time evolution of a matrix-product state. Here, we will review and summarize the recent work on this topic as applied to finite quantum systems. We will explain and compare the different methods available to construct a time-evolved matrix-product state, namely the time-evolving block decimation, the MPO WI,II method, the global Krylov method, the local Krylov method and the one- and two-site time-dependent variational principle. We will also apply these methods to four different representative examples of current problem settings in condensed matter physics.},

	abstract = {The recognition that large classes of quantum many-body systems have limited entanglement in the ground and low-lying excited states led to dramatic advances in their numerical simulation via so-called tensor networks. However, global dynamics elevates many particles into excited states, and can lead to macroscopic entanglement and the failure of tensor networks. Here, we show that for quantum transport—one of the most important cases of this failure—the fundamental issue is the canonical basis in which the scenario is cast: When particles flow through an interface, they scatter, generating a “bit” of entanglement between spatial regions with each event. The frequency basis naturally captures that—in the long-time limit and in the absence of inelastic scattering—particles tend to flow from a state with one frequency to a state of identical frequency. Recognizing this natural structure yields a striking—potentially exponential in some cases—increase in simulation efficiency, greatly extending the attainable spatial and time scales, and broadening the scope of tensor network simulation to hitherto inaccessible classes of nonequilibrium many-body problems.},

In terms of the block Green function matrix G (whose elements are Gīj=⟨c†icj⟩, where c†i and cj are fermion creation and annihilation operators acting on sites i and j within the block, respectively), the density matrix can be written as ρB=det(1−G)exp(∑ij[lnG(1−G)−1]ijc†icj). Our results suggest that Hilbert space truncation schemes should retain the states created by a subset of the c†i’s (in any combination), rather than selecting eigenvectors of ρB independently based on the eigenvalue.},

We quantify this through the entanglement negativity of states, and the introduction of an antisymmetric negativity, which allows us to understand the role that symmetrization plays in the measured entanglement properties. We apply this concept both to pure theoretical states and to experimentally reconstructed density matrices of two or three mobile particles in an array of optical tweezers.},

These states can be considered as generalized valence bond states, and they are dense in the set of all translation invariant states. We develop a complete theory of the ergodic decomposition of such states, including the decomposition into periodic “Néel ordered” states. The ergodic components have exponential decay of correlations. All states considered can be obtained as “local functions” of states of a special kind, so-called “purely generated states,” which are shown to be ground states for suitably chosen finite range VBS interactions. We show that all these generalized VBS models have a spectral gap. Our theory does not require symmetry of the state with respect to a local gauge group. In particular we illustrate our results with a one-parameter family of examples which are not isotropic except for one special case. This isotropic model coincides with the one-dimensional antiferromagnet, recently studied by Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb, and Tasaki.},

In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms. © 2010.},

  abstract = {Measures are introduced to quantify the degree of superposition in mixed states with respect to orthogonal decompositions of the Hilbert space of a quantum system. These superposition measures can be regarded as analogues to entanglement measures, but can also be put in a more direct relation to the latter. By a second quantization of the system it is possible to induce superposition measures from entanglement measures. We consider the measures induced from relative entropy of entanglement and entanglement of formation. We furthermore introduce a class of measures with an operational interpretation in terms of interferometry. We consider the superposition measures under the action of subspace preserving and local subspace preserving channels. The theory is illustrated with models of an atom undergoing a relaxation process in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.},

The first rigorous example of an isotropic model in such a phase is presented. The Hamiltonian has an exactSO(3) symmetry and is translationally invariant, but we prove the model has a unique ground state, a gap in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian immediately above the ground state and exponential decay of the correlation functions in the ground state. Models in two and higher dimension which are expected to have the same properties are also presented. For these models we construct an exact ground state, and for some of them we prove that the two-point function decays exponentially in this ground state. In all these models exact ground states are constructed by using valence bonds.},

We have checked this prediction in cluster Monte Carlo simulations of the classical two-dimensional AT model. We have also performed extensive numerical simulations of the anisotropic Heisenberg quantum spin chain with tree tensor network techniques that allowed us to obtain the reduced density matrices of disjoint blocks of the spin chain and to check the correctness of the predictions for R\'enyi and entanglement entropies from conformal field theory. In order to match these predictions, we have extrapolated the numerical results by properly taking into account the corrections induced by the finite length of the blocks on the leading scaling behavior.},

Focusing on gapped phases of one-dimensional systems, we show how this spectrum is dominated by contributions from the boundary between the parts. This contradicts the view of an "entanglement Hamiltonian" as a bulk entity. The boundary-local nature of the entanglement spectrum is clarified through its hierarchical level structure, through the combination of two single-boundary spectra to form a two-boundary spectrum, and finally through consideration of dominant eigenfunctions of the entanglement Hamiltonian. We use the boundary-locality to formulate a perturbative scheme for calculating entanglement spectra.},

We provide the analytic conformal field theory result for the second order R\'enyi entropy for a free boson compactified on an orbifold describing the scaling limit of the Ashkin\textendash Teller (AT) model on the self-dual line. We have checked this prediction in cluster Monte Carlo simulations of the classical two-dimensional AT model. We have also performed extensive numerical simulations of the anisotropic Heisenberg quantum spin chain with tree tensor network techniques that allowed us to obtain the reduced density matrices of disjoint blocks of the spin chain and to check the correctness of the predictions for R\'enyi and entanglement entropies from conformal field theory. In order to match these predictions, we have extrapolated the numerical results by properly taking into account the corrections induced by the finite length of the blocks on the leading scaling behavior.},

We provide numerical evidence that ETH holds for typical eigenstates (weak ETH scenario). Specifically, using a numerical implementation of state-of-the-art Bethe ansatz results, we study the finite-size scaling of the eigenstate-to-eigenstate fluctuations of the reduced density matrix. We find that fluctuations are normally distributed, and their standard deviation decays in the thermodynamic limit as L\^\{-1/2\}, with L the size of the chain. This is in contrast with the exponential decay that is found in generic non-integrable systems. Based on our results, it is natural to expect that this scenario holds in other integrable spin models and for typical local observables. Finally, we investigate the entanglement properties of the excited states of the XXX chain. We numerically verify that typical mid-spectrum eigenstates exhibit extensive entanglement entropy (i.e., volume-law scaling).},

  abstract = {Entanglement and entropy are key concepts standing at the foundations of quantum and statistical mechanics. Recently, the study of quantum quenches revealed that these concepts are intricately intertwined. Although the unitary time evolution ensuing from a pure state maintains the system at zero entropy, local properties at long times are captured by a statistical ensemble with nonzero thermodynamic entropy, which is the entanglement accumulated during the dynamics. Therefore, understanding the entanglement evolution unveils how thermodynamics emerges in isolated systems. Alas, an exact computation of the entanglement dynamics was available so far only for noninteracting systems, whereas it was deemed unfeasible for interacting ones. Here, we show that the standard quasiparticle picture of the entanglement evolution, complemented with integrability-based knowledge of the steady state and its excitations, leads to a complete understanding of the entanglement dynamics in the space\textendash time scaling limit. We thoroughly check our result for the paradigmatic Heisenberg chain.},

Here we investigate the entanglement dynamics after an inhomogeneous quench in integrable systems. This is the prototypical setup for studying quantum transport, and it consists in the sudden junction of two macroscopically different states. By exploiting the recently developed integrable hydrodynamic approach and the quasiparticle picture for the entanglement dynamics, we conjecture a formula for the entanglement production rate after joining two semi-infinite reservoirs, as well as the steady-state entanglement entropy of a finite subregion. We show that both quantities are determined by the quasiparticles created in the Non Equilibrium steady State (NESS) appearing at large times at the interface between the two reservoirs. Specifically, the steady-state entropy coincides with the thermodynamic entropy of the NESS, whereas the entropy production rate reflects its spreading into the bulk of the two reservoirs. Our results are numerically corroborated using tDMRG simulations in the paradigmatic XXZ spin-\$1/2\$ chain.},

Three primary signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation were seen. (i) On top of a broad thermal velocity distribution, a narrow peak appeared that was centered at zero velocity. (ii) The fraction of the atoms that were in this low-velocity peak increased abruptly as the sample temperature was lowered. (iii) The peak exhibited a nonthermal, anisotropic velocity distribution expected of the minimum-energy quantum state of the magnetic trap in contrast to the isotropic, thermal velocity distribution observed in the broad uncondensed fraction.},

In rational CFTs, which have central charge below a critical value, entanglement entropy behaves as if correlations were carried by free quasiparticles. This leads to long-term memory effects, such as spikes in the mutual information of widely separated regions at late times. When the central charge is above the critical value, the quasiparticle picture fails. Assuming no extended symmetry algebra, any theory with c {$>$} 1 has diminished memory effects compared to the rational models. In holographic CFTs, with c {$\gg$} 1, these memory effects are eliminated altogether at strong coupling, but reappear after the scrambling time t {$\greaterequivlnt$} {$\beta$} log c at weak coupling.},

Hence different points of view can give rise to different reasonable definitions of separable and entangled states. Here we analyze these possibilities and the relationship between the different classes of separable states. The behavior of the various classes when taking multiple copies of a state is also studied, showing that some of the differences vanish in the asymptotic regime. In particular, in the case of only two fermionic modes all the classes become equivalent in this limit. We illustrate the differences and relations by providing a complete characterization of all the sets defined for systems of two fermionic modes. The results are applied to Gibbs states of infinite chains of fermions whose interaction corresponds to a XY Hamiltonian with transverse magnetic field.},

A special attention is paid to a term proportional to 1/N closely related to the theory of free massless Majorana fermions. An effective Hamiltonian isomorphic to that in conformally invariant theory is derived. The eigenvectors of the Ising Hamiltonian are classified in the framework of conformal algebra representation theory. The momentum and the energy for these states are expressed through the central charge and conformal dimensions. A similar relation for the logarithms of the transfer-matrix eigenvalues is ascertained. These are complex-valued functions of a spectral parameter \texttheta. A real part of such a function is shown to be proportional to sin \texttheta, while an imaginary one - to cos\texttheta. A direct geometrical interpretation of the lattice spectral parameter in the context of the conformally invariant theory for fermions inhabiting a torus is indicated. In other words, these fermions are represented as analytic anticommuting variables double (anti) periodic in a complex plane. The value of the spectral parameter coincides with an angle between these (anti) periods. A general scheme for the above expansion presumably suitable for a wide class of exactly solvable models is conjectured.},

We quantify this through the entanglement negativity of states, and the introduction of an antisymmetric negativity, which allows us to understand the role that symmetrisation plays in the measured entanglement properties. We apply this concept both to pure theoretical states and to experimentally reconstructed density matrices of two or three mobile particles in an array of optical tweezers.},

  abstract = {There are a number of similarities between black-hole physics and thermodynamics. Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples., This article appears in the following collection:},

It is shown that the local fields forming the operator algebra can be classified according to the irreducible representations of Virasoro algebra, and that the correlation functions are built up of the ``conformal blocks'' which are completely determined by the conformal invariance. Exactly solvable conformal theories associated with the degenerate representations are analyzed. In these theories the anomalous dimensions are known exactly and the correlation functions satisfy the systems of linear differential equations.},

  abstract = {We consider the nonequilibrium time evolution of piecewise homogeneous states in the XXZ spin-1/2 chain, a paradigmatic example of an interacting integrable model. The initial state can be thought of as the result of joining chains with different global properties. Through dephasing, at late times, the state becomes locally equivalent to a stationary state which explicitly depends on position and time. We propose a kinetic theory of elementary excitations and derive a continuity equation which fully characterizes the thermodynamics of the model. We restrict ourselves to the gapless phase and consider cases where the chains are prepared: (1) at different temperatures, (2) in the ground state of two different models, and (3) in the ``domain wall'' state. We find excellent agreement (any discrepancy is within the numerical error) between theoretical predictions and numerical simulations of time evolution based on time-evolving block decimation algorithms. As a corollary, we unveil an exact expression for the expectation values of the charge currents in a generic stationary state.},

  abstract = {Tensor network methods are taking a central role in modern quantum physics and beyond. They can provide an efficient approximation to certain classes of quantum states, and the associated graphical language makes it easy to describe and pictorially reason about quantum circuits, channels, protocols, open systems and more. Our goal is to explain tensor networks and some associated methods as quickly and as painlessly as possible. Beginning with the key definitions, the graphical tensor network language is presented through examples. We then provide an introduction to matrix product states. We conclude the tutorial with tensor contractions evaluating combinatorial counting problems. The first one counts the number of solutions for Boolean formulae, whereas the second is Penrose's tensor contraction algorithm, returning the number of \$3\$-edge-colorings of \$3\$-regular planar graphs.},

The book has 7 parts and over 40 subsections which took shape in over a decade of teaching. In addition to covering the foundations, the book covers important applications such as matrix product states, open quantum systems and entanglement \$-\$ all cast into the diagrammatic tensor network language. The intended audience includes those in quantum information science wishing to learn about tensor networks. It includes scientists who have employed tensor networks in their modeling codes who have interest in the tools graphical reasoning capacity. The audience further includes the graduate student researcher, whom with some effort, should find this book accessible. I would appreciate it if you emailed me about any mistakes or typos you find.},

Using the bosonization technique this model is mapped onto the Gaussian model at a particular value of the temperature (K=1/{$\pi$}). This allows us to give the expressions for products of order, disorder, and energy operators of both Ising models in terms of operators in the Gaussian model. We compute several correlation functions of order, disorder, energy and spinor operators and show that they reproduce the operator product expansions predicted by conformal invariance.

At these high phase-space densities, diffraction of a probe laser beam is observed. Modeling shows that this diffraction is a sensitive indicator of the presence of a spatially localized condensate. Although measurements of the number of condensate atoms have not been performed, the measured phase-space densities are consistent with a majority of the atoms being in the condensate, for total trap numbers as high as 2\texttimes 105 atoms.

  abstract = {In this book we describe the elementary theory of operator algebras and parts of the advanced theory which are of relevance, or potentially of relevance, to mathematical physics. Subsequently we describe various applications to quantum statistical mechanics. At the outset of this project we intended to cover this material in one volume but in the course of develop\- ment it was realized that this would entail the omission ofvarious interesting topics or details. Consequently the book was split into two volumes, the first devoted to the general theory of operator algebras and the second to the applications. This splitting into theory and applications is conventional but somewhat arbitrary. In the last 15-20 years mathematical physicists have realized the importance of operator algebras and their states and automorphisms for problems of field theory and statistical mechanics. But the theory of 20 years aga was largely developed for the analysis of group representations and it was inadequate for many physical applications. Thus after a short honey\- moon period in which the new found tools of the extant theory were applied to the most amenable problems a longer and more interesting period ensued in which mathematical physicists were forced to redevelop the theory in relevant directions. New concepts were introduced, e. g. asymptotic abelian\- ness and KMS states, new techniques applied, e. g. the Choquet theory of barycentric decomposition for states, and new structural results obtained, e. g. the existence of a continuum of nonisomorphic type-three factors.},

  abstract = {We study multi-qubit quantum channels that can be represented as a product of one-mode fermionic attenuation channels. An explicit formula for the classical capacity \$C\_1\$ and for the minimum output entropy \$S\_\{min\}\$ of these channels is proposed. We compute \$S\_\{min\}\$ analytically for any number of qubits under assumption that the minimum is achieved on a Gaussian input. Apart from that, a simple numerical method for evaluating \$S\_\{min\}\$ is developed. The method is applicable to any channels that are sufficiently noisy. For fermionic product channels the proposed formula for \$S\_\{min\}\$ agrees with the numerical results with a precision about \$10\^\{-9\}\$.},

  abstract = {The Lieb-Robinson bound states that local Hamiltonian evolution in nonrelativistic quantum mechanical theories gives rise to the notion of an effective light cone with exponentially decaying tails. We discuss several consequences of this result in the context of quantum information theory. First, we show that the information that leaks out to spacelike separated regions is negligible and that there is a finite speed at which correlations and entanglement can be distributed. Second, we discuss how these ideas can be used to prove lower bounds on the time it takes to convert states without topological quantum order to states with that property. Finally, we show that the rate at which entropy can be created in a block of spins scales like the boundary of that block.},

  abstract = {We carry out a systematic study of entanglement entropy in relativistic quantum field theory. This is defined as the von Neumann entropy SA = -Tr {$\rho$}Alog{$\rho$}A corresponding to the reduced density matrix {$\rho$}A of a subsystem A. For the case of a 1+1-dimensional critical system, whose continuum limit is a conformal field theory with central charge c, we re-derive the result of Holzhey et al when A is a finite interval of length in an infinite system, and extend it to many other cases: finite systems, finite temperatures, and when A consists of an arbitrary number of disjoint intervals. For such a system away from its critical point, when the correlation length {$\xi$} is large but finite, we show that , where is the number of boundary points of A. These results are verified for a free massive field theory, which is also used to confirm a scaling ansatz for the case of finite size off-critical systems, and for integrable lattice models, such as the Ising and XXZ models, which are solvable by corner transfer matrix methods. Finally the free field results are extended to higher dimensions, and used to motivate a scaling form for the singular part of the entanglement entropy near a quantum phase transition.},

  abstract = {We consider the time evolution of observables in the transverse-field Ising chain after a sudden quench of the magnetic field. We provide exact analytical results for the asymptotic time and distance dependence of one-and two-point correlation functions of the order parameter. We employ two complementary approaches based on asymptotic evaluations of determinants and form-factor sums. We prove that the stationary value of the two-point correlation function is not thermal, but can be described by a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). The approach to the stationary state can also be understood in terms of a GGE. We present a conjecture on how these results generalize to particular quenches in other integrable models. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.227203 PACS numbers: 75.10.Pq, 02.30.Ik, 03.67.Mn, 67.85.\`Ad Recent experiments on trapped cold atomic gases [1,2] have raised intriguing fundamental questions regarding the nonequilibrium dynamics of correlated many-body quan-tum systems. These cold atom systems are sufficiently weakly coupled to their environments as to allow the observation of essentially unitary nonequilibrium time evolution on long time scales. The quantum Newton's cradle experiments of Kinoshita et al. [2] in particular have focused attention on the roles played by dimension-ality and conservation laws. The observed absence of ''thermalization'' in quasi-one-dimensional condensates was attributed to the experimental system being approxi-mately describable by a quantum integrable many-body theory. This in turn initiated vigorous research on clarify-ing the role played by quantum integrability in determining the stationary (late time) behavior of nonequilibrium evo-lution in correlated quantum systems [3\textendash 9]. The simplest way of driving a quantum system out of equilibrium is by means of a quantum quench: a system is prepared in the ground state of a given Hamiltonian H\dh h 0 \TH, where h 0 is an experimentally tunable parameter such as a bulk magnetic field. At time t {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0 the parameter h 0 is changed suddenly to a different value h and one then considers the unitary time evolution of the system by means of the new Hamiltonian H\dh h\TH. Central issues that have been investi-gated are whether the system relaxes to a stationary state, and if it does, how to characterize its physical properties at late times. It is widely believed (see, e.g., [10] for a comprehensive summary) that the behavior of local ob-servables (such as one and two-point correlation functions) can be described in terms of either an effective thermal (Gibbs) distribution or a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) [3]. It has been argued that the latter arises for integrable models, while the former obtains for generic systems [3\textendash 6]. However, several recent studies [7\textendash 9] sug-gest that the behavior is more complicated and, in particu-lar, depends on the initial state. Moreover, open questions remain even with regards to the very existence of stationary states. For example, the order parameters of certain mean-field models have recently been shown to display persistent oscillations [11]. Two recent works have raised another crucial issue in the debate on thermalization, namely, the role played by the considered observables [8,12]. More precisely, it was pointed out that the locality of the observ-able with respect to the elementary excitations is expected to affect the late time behavior of an observable after a quantum quench. In light of the available experimental and theoretical results further clarification of the role of inte-grability on the time evolution after a quantum quench calls for exact analytical results on ''generic'' correlation functions, i.e., those corresponding to observables nonlocal with respect to the elementary excitations. In the following we present such results for the particular case of the transverse-field Ising chain, which is a crucial paradigm for quantum critical behavior. While the model admits a representation in terms of free fermions, the order parame-ter is nonlocal with respect to the fermionic degrees of freedom, which renders it an ideal testing ground for thermalization ideas. Although the model has been widely analyzed in the context of quantum quenches [13\textendash 17], the nonequilbrium evolution of order parameter correlation functions is still not known analytically. In this Letter we present analytical results for the full asymptotic time and distance dependence of one-and two-point correlation functions of the order parameter in the thermodynamic limit after a quantum quench within the ferromagnetic phase. We also present partial results for quenches within the paramagnetic phase and across the critical point. Our results are obtained by two independent, novel methods. The first is based on the determinant representation of correlation functions characteristic of free-fermionic theo-ries. The second is based on the form-factor approach [18] and is applicable more generally to integrable quenches in interacting quantum field theories [19]. This method com-plements existing analytical or seminumerical methods used for studying quantum quenches in integrable systems},

  abstract = {We consider the time evolution of observables in the transverse-field Ising chain after a sudden quench of the magnetic field. We provide exact analytical results for the asymptotic time and distance dependence of one-and two-point correlation functions of the order parameter. We employ two complementary approaches based on asymptotic evaluations of determinants and form-factor sums. We prove that the stationary value of the two-point correlation function is not thermal, but can be described by a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). The approach to the stationary state can also be understood in terms of a GGE. We present a conjecture on how these results generalize to particular quenches in other integrable models. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.227203 PACS numbers: 75.10.Pq, 02.30.Ik, 03.67.Mn, 67.85.\`Ad Recent experiments on trapped cold atomic gases [1,2] have raised intriguing fundamental questions regarding the nonequilibrium dynamics of correlated many-body quan-tum systems. These cold atom systems are sufficiently weakly coupled to their environments as to allow the observation of essentially unitary nonequilibrium time evolution on long time scales. The quantum Newton's cradle experiments of Kinoshita et al. [2] in particular have focused attention on the roles played by dimension-ality and conservation laws. The observed absence of ''thermalization'' in quasi-one-dimensional condensates was attributed to the experimental system being approxi-mately describable by a quantum integrable many-body theory. This in turn initiated vigorous research on clarify-ing the role played by quantum integrability in determining the stationary (late time) behavior of nonequilibrium evo-lution in correlated quantum systems [3\textendash 9]. The simplest way of driving a quantum system out of equilibrium is by means of a quantum quench: a system is prepared in the ground state of a given Hamiltonian H\dh h 0 \TH, where h 0 is an experimentally tunable parameter such as a bulk magnetic field. At time t {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0 the parameter h 0 is changed suddenly to a different value h and one then considers the unitary time evolution of the system by means of the new Hamiltonian H\dh h\TH. Central issues that have been investi-gated are whether the system relaxes to a stationary state, and if it does, how to characterize its physical properties at late times. It is widely believed (see, e.g., [10] for a comprehensive summary) that the behavior of local ob-servables (such as one and two-point correlation functions) can be described in terms of either an effective thermal (Gibbs) distribution or a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) [3]. It has been argued that the latter arises for integrable models, while the former obtains for generic systems [3\textendash 6]. However, several recent studies [7\textendash 9] sug-gest that the behavior is more complicated and, in particu-lar, depends on the initial state. Moreover, open questions remain even with regards to the very existence of stationary states. For example, the order parameters of certain mean-field models have recently been shown to display persistent oscillations [11]. Two recent works have raised another crucial issue in the debate on thermalization, namely, the role played by the considered observables [8,12]. More precisely, it was pointed out that the locality of the observ-able with respect to the elementary excitations is expected to affect the late time behavior of an observable after a quantum quench. In light of the available experimental and theoretical results further clarification of the role of inte-grability on the time evolution after a quantum quench calls for exact analytical results on ''generic'' correlation functions, i.e., those corresponding to observables nonlocal with respect to the elementary excitations. In the following we present such results for the particular case of the transverse-field Ising chain, which is a crucial paradigm for quantum critical behavior. While the model admits a representation in terms of free fermions, the order parame-ter is nonlocal with respect to the fermionic degrees of freedom, which renders it an ideal testing ground for thermalization ideas. Although the model has been widely analyzed in the context of quantum quenches [13\textendash 17], the nonequilbrium evolution of order parameter correlation functions is still not known analytically. In this Letter we present analytical results for the full asymptotic time and distance dependence of one-and two-point correlation functions of the order parameter in the thermodynamic limit after a quantum quench within the ferromagnetic phase. We also present partial results for quenches within the paramagnetic phase and across the critical point. Our results are obtained by two independent, novel methods. The first is based on the determinant representation of correlation functions characteristic of free-fermionic theo-ries. The second is based on the form-factor approach [18] and is applicable more generally to integrable quenches in interacting quantum field theories [19]. This method com-plements existing analytical or seminumerical methods used for studying quantum quenches in integrable systems},

For a system of Gaussian fermions, the fermionic analog of linear or Gaussian optics, these dynamics can be elegantly and efficiently described by evolution of the system's covariance matrix. Taking both system and bath to be Gaussian fermionic, we observe that decoherence occurs at a rate that is independent of the bath temperature. Furthermore, we also consider a weak coupling regime where the dynamics are Markovian. We present a microscopic derivation of Markovian master equations entirely in the language of covariance matrices, where temperature independence remains manifest. This is radically different from behaviour seen in other scenarios, such as when fermions interact with a bosonic bath. Our analysis applies to many Majorana fermion systems that have been heralded as very robust, topologically protected, qubits. In these systems, it has been claimed that thermal decoherence can be exponentially suppressed by reducing temperature, but we find Gaussian decoherence cannot be cooled away.},

We derive analytic expressions for the gap in all phases for large values of the chain length L, as a function of the boundary field strength. We also investigate the behaviour of the chain in the quantum ferromagnetic phase for oppositely aligned fields, focusing on the magnet-to-kink transition that occurs at a finite value of the magnetic field strength. At this transition we compute analytically the finite-size crossover functions for the gap, the magnetisation profile, the two-point correlation function, and the density of fermionic modes. As the magnet-to-kink transition is equivalent to the wetting transition in two-dimensional classical Ising models, our results provide new analytic predictions for the finite-size behaviour of Ising systems in a strip geometry at this transition.},

Conversely, general properties of the transfer matrix imply constraints on the allowed operator content of the theory. We show that unitary theories with a finite number of primary operators must have a conformal anomaly number c {$<$} 1, and therefore must fall into the classification of Friedan, Qiu and Shenker. For such theories, we derive sum rules which constrain the numbers of operators with given scaling dimensions.},

We note the remarkable fact that, for some integrable models, these partition functions have the same form away from criticality, with the modular parameter q of the annulus replaced by a temperature-like variable, and give a partial explanation of this in the case of the Ising model.},

In particular, the coefficients of the identity operator, which fix the one-point functions, are determined by the elements of the matrix S which implements modular transformations on the torus. The other coefficients are related, in addition, to the elements of the matrices implementing duality transformations on the conformal blocks of the four-point functions on the sphere.

Hence the conformal transformation maps the entanglement entropy to the thermodynamic entropy of this thermal state. The AdS/CFT dictionary allows us to calculate this thermodynamic entropy as the horizon entropy of a certain topological black hole. In even dimensions, we also demonstrate that the universal contribution to the entanglement entropy is given by A-type trace anomaly for any CFT, without reference to holography.},

With experiments accessing the intricate dynamics of many-body quantum systems, it is paramount to develop powerful methods that encode the emergent physics. Up to now, the strong dichotomy observed between integrable and nonintegrable evolutions made an overarching theory difficult to build, especially for transport phenomena where space-time profiles are drastically different. We present a novel framework for studying transport in integrable systems: hydrodynamics with infinitely many conservation laws. This bridges the conceptual gap between integrable and nonintegrable quantum dynamics, and gives powerful tools for accurate studies of space-time profiles. We apply it to the description of energy transport between heat baths, and provide a full description of the current-carrying nonequilibrium steady state and the transition regions in a family of models including the Lieb-Liniger model of interacting Bose gases, realized in experiments.},

Using a unifying quasiparticle framework, we unveil a rich structure of the correlation cone, which encodes the footprints of several microscopic properties of the system. When the quasiparticle excitations propagate with a bounded group velocity, we show that the correlation edge and correlation maxima move with different velocities that we derive. For systems with a divergent group velocity, especially relevant for long-range interacting systems, the correlation edge propagates slower than ballistic. In contrast, the correlation maxima propagate faster than ballistic in gapless systems but ballistic in gapped systems. Our results shed light on existing experimental and numerical observations and pave the way to the next generation of experiments. For instance, we argue that the dynamics of correlation maxima can be used as a witness of the elementary excitations of the system.},

  abstract = {In the context of characterizing the structure of quantum entanglement in many-body systems, we introduce the entanglement contour, a tool to identify which real-space degrees of freedom contribute, and how much, to the entanglement of a region A with the rest of the system B. The entanglement contour provides a complementary, more re?fined approach to characterizing entanglement than just considering the entanglement entropy between A and B, with several concrete advantages. We illustrate this in the context of ground states and quantum quenches in fermionic quadratic systems. For instance, in a quantum critical system in \$D = 1\$ spatial dimensions, the entanglement contour allows us to determine the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory from just a single partition of the system into regions A and B, (using the entanglement entropy for the same task requires considering several partitions). In \$D \textbackslash backslashgeq 2\$ dimensions, the entanglement contour can distinguish between gapped and gapless phases that obey a same boundary law for entanglement entropy. During a local or global quantum quench, the time-dependent contour provides a detailed account of the dynamics of entanglement, including propagating entanglement waves, which offers a microscopic explanation of the behavior of the entanglement entropy as a function of time.},

  abstract = {Quantum resource theories (QRTs) offer a highly versatile and powerful framework for studying different phenomena in quantum physics. From quantum entanglement to quantum computation, resource theories can be used to quantify a desirable quantum effect, develop new protocols for its detection, and identify processes that optimize its use for a given application. Particularly, QRTs have revolutionized the way we think about familiar properties of physical systems such as entanglement, elevating them from being just interesting fundamental phenomena to being useful in performing practical tasks. The basic methodology of a general QRT involves partitioning all quantum states into two groups, one consisting of free states and the other consisting of resource states. Accompanying the set of free states is a collection of free quantum operations arising from natural restrictions placed on the physical system, restrictions that force the free operations to act invariantly on the set of free states. The QRT then studies what information processing tasks become possible using the restricted operations. Despite the large degree of freedom in how one defines the free states and free operations, unexpected similarities emerge among different QRTs in terms of resource measures and resource convertibility. As a result, objects that appear quite distinct on the surface, such as entanglement and quantum reference frames, appear to have great similarity on a deeper structural level. This article reviews the general framework of a quantum resource theory, focusing on common structural features, operational tasks, and resource measures. To illustrate these concepts, an overview is provided on some of the more commonly studied QRTs in the literature.},

While the entanglement spectrum of the ground state of a gapped theory on a finite interval of length 2R with suitable boundary conditions, bipartitioned into two equal pieces, turns out to exhibit a crossover between the finite-size spectra of the same CFT with in general different boundary conditions as the system size R crosses the correlation length from the ``critical regime'' R{$\ll\xi$} to the ``gapped regime'' R{$\gg\xi$}, the physical spectrum on a finite interval of length R with the same boundary conditions, on the other hand, is known to undergo a dramatic reorganization during the same crossover from being discrete to being continuous.},

In this work, we provide an exact duality mapping between the bulk of a quantum spin system and its boundary using projected entangled-pair states. This duality associates to every region a Hamiltonian on its boundary, in such a way that the entanglement spectrum of the bulk corresponds to the excitation spectrum of the boundary Hamiltonian. We study various specific models: a deformed AKLT model [I. Affleck, T. Kennedy, E. H. Lieb, and H. Tasaki, Phys. Rev. Lett. 59, 799 (1987)], an Ising-type model [F. Verstraete, M. M. Wolf, D.

In the second case, some of those models display quantum phase transitions. We find that a gapped bulk phase with local order corresponds to a boundary Hamiltonian with local interactions, whereas critical behavior in the bulk is reflected on a diverging interaction length of the boundary Hamiltonian. Furthermore, topologically ordered states yield nonlocal Hamiltonians. Because our duality also associates a boundary operator to any operator in the bulk, it in fact provides a full holographic framework for the study of quantum many-body systems via their boundary.},

The underlying lattices are described as general graphs of not necessarily integer dimension, including translationally invariant instances of cubic lattices as special cases. Any local quadratic couplings in position and momentum coordinates are allowed for, leading to quasi-free (Gaussian) ground states. We make use of methods of deriving bounds to matrix functions of banded matrices corresponding to local interactions on general graphs. Finally, we give an explicit entanglement-area relationship in terms of the energy gap for arbitrary, not necessarily contiguous regions on lattices characterized by general graphs.},

  abstract = {We prove that quantum many-body systems on a one-dimensional lattice locally relax to Gaussian states under non-equilibrium dynamics generated by a bosonic quadratic Hamiltonian. This is true for a large class of initial states - pure or mixed - which have to satisfy merely weak conditions concerning the decay of correlations. The considered setting is a proven instance of a situation where dynamically evolving closed quantum systems locally appear as if they had truly relaxed, to maximum entropy states for fixed second moments. This furthers the understanding of relaxation in suddenly quenched quantum many-body systems. The proof features a non-commutative central limit theorem for non-i.i.d. random variables, showing convergence to Gaussian characteristic functions, giving rise to trace-norm closeness. We briefly relate our findings to ideas of typicality and concentration of measure.},

  abstract = {An algorithm is presented which computes a translationally invariant matrix product state approximation of the ground state of an infinite one-dimensional (1D) system. It does this by embedding sites into an approximation of the infinite ``environment'' of the chain, allowing the sites to relax and then merging them with the environment in order to refine the approximation. By making use of matrix product operators, our approach is able to directly model any long-range interaction that can be systematically approximated by a series of decaying exponentials. We apply these techniques to compute the ground state of the Haldane-Shastry model [Phys. Rev. Lett. 60, 635 (1988) and Phys. Rev. Lett. 60, 639 (1988)] and present the results.},

We consider two such descriptions: (i) as a matrix product density operator of bond dimension D; and (ii) as a purification that is written as a matrix product state of bond dimension D{${'}$}. We show that these descriptions are inequivalent in the sense that D{${'}$} cannot be upper bounded by D only. Then we provide two constructive methods to obtain (ii) out of (i). The sum of squares (sos) polynomial method scales exponentially in the number of different eigenvalues, and its approximate version is formulated as a semidefinite program, which gives efficient approximate purifications whose D{${'}$} only depends on D. The eigenbasis method scales quadratically in the number of eigenvalues, and its approximate version is very efficient for rapidly decaying distributions of eigenvalues. Our results imply that a description of mixed states which is both efficient and locally positive semidefinite does not exist, but that good approximations do.},

To this end, we present a brief overview of classical and quantum chaos, as well as RMT and some of its most important predictions. The latter include the statistics of energy levels, eigenstate components, and matrix elements of observables. Building on these, we introduce the ETH and show that it allows one to describe thermalization in isolated chaotic systems without invoking the notion of an external bath. We examine numerical evidence of eigenstate thermalization from studies of many-body lattice systems. We also introduce the concept of a quench as a means of taking isolated systems out of equilibrium, and discuss results of numerical experiments on quantum quenches. The second part of the review explores the implications of quantum chaos and ETH to thermodynamics. Basic thermodynamic relations are derived, including the second law of thermodynamics, the fundamental thermodynamic relation, fluctuation theorems, and the Einstein and Onsager relations. In particular, it is shown that quantum chaos allows one to prove these relations for individual Hamiltonian eigenstates and thus extend them to arbitrary stationary statistical ensembles. We then show how one can use these relations to obtain nontrivial universal energy distributions in continuously driven systems. At the end of the review, we briefly discuss the relaxation dynamics and description after relaxation of integrable quantum systems, for which ETH is violated. We introduce the concept of the generalized Gibbs ensemble, and discuss its connection with ideas of prethermalization in weakly interacting systems.},

Evaporative cooling increased the phase-space density by 6 orders of magnitude within seven seconds. Condensates contained up to 5\texttimes 105 atoms at densities exceeding 1014 cm-3. The striking signature of Bose condensation was the sudden appearance of a bimodal velocity distribution below the critical temperature of {$\sim$}2{$\mu$}K. The distribution consisted of an isotropic thermal distribution and an elliptical core attributed to the expansion of a dense condensate., This article appears in the following collection:},

It has been shown by Bravyi [Phys. Rev. A 73, 042313 (2006)] that under the assumption of perfect braiding operations, universal quantum computation is possible if the noise rate on a particular 4-fermion ancilla is below 40\%. We show that beyond a noise rate of 89\% on this ancilla the quantum computation can be efficiently simulated classically: we explicitly show that the noisy ancilla is a convex mixture of Gaussian fermionic states in this region, while for noise rates below 53\% we prove that the state is not a mixture of Gaussian states. These results were obtained by generalizing concepts in entanglement theory to the setting of Gaussian states and their convex mixtures. In particular we develop a complete set of criteria, namely the existence of a Gaussian-symmetric extension, which determine whether a state is a convex mixture of Gaussian states.},

Its foundations are rooted into the paradigm of statistical mechanics, where thermal properties originate from averaging procedures which smoothen out local details. While undoubtedly successful, elegant and formally correct, this approach carries over an operational problem: what is the precision at which such variables are inferred, when technical/practical limitations restrict our capabilities to local probing? Here we introduce the local quantum thermal susceptibility, a quantifier for the best achievable accuracy for temperature estimation via local measurements. Our method relies on basic concepts of quantum estimation theory, providing an operative strategy to address the local thermal response of arbitrary quantum systems at equilibrium. At low temperatures it highlights the local distinguishability of the ground state from the excited sub-manifolds, thus providing a method to locate quantum phase transitions.},

  abstract = {We review quantum phase transitions of spin systems in transverse magnetic fields taking the examples of some paradigmatic models, namely, the spin-1/2 Ising and XY models in a transverse field in one and higher spatial dimensions. Beginning with a brief overview of quantum phase transitions, we introduce the model Hamiltonians and discuss the equivalence between the quantum phase transition in such a model and the finite temperature phase transition in a higher dimensional classical model. We then provide exact solutions in one spatial dimension connecting them to conformal field theoretical studies when possible. We also discuss Kitaev models, and some other exactly solvable spin systems in this context. Studies of quantum phase transitions in the presence of quenched randomness and with frustrating interactions are presented in details. We discuss novel phenomena like Griffiths-McCoy singularities associated with quantum phase transitions of low- dimensional transverse Ising models with random interactions and transverse fields. We then turn to more recent topics like information theoretic measures of the quantum phase transitions in these models; we elaborate on the scaling behaviors of concurrence, entanglement entropy (for both pure and random models), quantum discord and quantum fidelity close to a quantum critical point. At the same time, we discuss the decoherence (or Loschmidt echo) of a qubit coupled to a quantum critical spin chain. We then focus on non-equilibrium dynamics of a variety of transverse field systems across quantum critical points and lines. After briefly mentioning rapid quenching studies, we dwell on slow dynamics and discuss the Kibble-Zurek scaling for the defect density following a quench across critical points and its modifications for quenching across critical lines, gapless regions and multicritical points. We present a brief discussion on adiabatic perturbation theory indicating the limits of slow and sudden quenching; we introduce the concept of a generalized fidelity susceptibility in this context. Topics like the role of different quenching schemes, local quenching, quenching of models with random interactions and quenching of a spin chain coupled to a heat bath are touched upon. The connection between non-equilibrium dynamics and quantum information theoretic measures (introduced in the previous section) is presented at some length. We indicate the connection between Kibble-Zurek scaling and adiabatic evolution of a state as well as the application of adiabatic dynamics as a tool of a quantum optimization technique known as quantumannealing (or adiabatic quantumcomputation). The final section is dedicated to a detailed discussion on recent experimental studies of transverse Ising-like systems},

  abstract = {Physical interactions in quantum many-body systems are typically local: Individual constituents interact mainly with their few nearest neighbors. This locality of interactions is inherited by a decay of correlation functions, but also reflected by scaling laws of a quite profound quantity: the entanglement entropy of ground states. This entropy of the reduced state of a subregion often merely grows like the boundary area of the subregion, and not like its volume, in sharp contrast with an expected extensive behavior. Such ``area laws'' for the entanglement entropy and related quantities have received considerable attention in recent years. They emerge in several seemingly unrelated fields, in the context of black hole physics, quantum information science, and quantum many-body physics where they have important implications on the numerical simulation of lattice models. In this Colloquium the current status of area laws in these fields is reviewed. Center stage is taken by rigorous results on lattice models in one and higher spatial dimensions. The differences and similarities between bosonic and fermionic models are stressed, area laws are related to the velocity of information propagation in quantum lattice models, and disordered systems, nonequilibrium situations, and topological entanglement entropies are discussed. These questions are considered in classical and quantum systems, in their ground and thermal states, for a variety of correlation measures. A significant proportion is devoted to the clear and quantitative connection between the entanglement content of states and the possibility of their efficient numerical simulation. Matrix-product states, higher-dimensional analogs, and variational sets from entanglement renormalization are also discussed and the paper is concluded by highlighting the implications of area laws on quantifying the effective degrees of freedom that need to be considered in simulations of quantum states.},

Here we provide an overview of this progress, specifically in studies probing dynamical equilibration and thermalization of systems driven out of equilibrium by quenches, ramps and periodic driving. In doing so, we also address topics such as the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, typicality, transport, many-body localization and universality near phase transitions, as well as future prospects for quantum simulation.},

Here we show that, by adding a boundary to the MERA, an accurate approximation to the ground state of a semi-infinite critical chain with an open boundary is obtained, from which one can extract boundary scaling operators and their scaling dimensions. As in Wilson's renormalization-group formulation of the Kondo problem, our construction produces, as a side result, an effective chain displaying explicit separation of energy scales. We present benchmark results for the quantum Ising and quantum XX models with free and fixed boundary conditions.},

  abstract = {We propose the use of entanglement renormalization techniques to study  boundary critical phenomena on a lattice system. The multiscale  entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), in its scale invariant  version, offers a very compact approximation to quantum critical ground  states. Here we show that, by adding a boundary to the MERA, an accurate  approximation to the ground state of a semi-infinite critical chain with  an open boundary is obtained, from which one can extract boundary  scaling operators and their scaling dimensions. As in Wilson's  renormalization-group formulation of the Kondo problem, our construction  produces, as a side result, an effective chain displaying explicit  separation of energy scales. We present benchmark results for the  quantum Ising and quantum XX models with free and fixed boundary  conditions.},

Not only does the ground state transform from a condensate like state to an effective Fermi sea, but new fundamental excitations, which do not have any higher-dimensional equivalents, are predicted to appear. In this work, we trace these elusive excitations via their effects on the dynamical structure factor of 1D strongly interacting Bose gases at low temperature. An array of 1D Bose gases is obtained by loading a 87Rb condensate in a two-dimensional lattice potential. The dynamical structure factor of the system is probed by energy deposition through low-momentum Bragg excitations. The experimental signals are compared to recent theoretical predictions for the dynamical structure factor of the Lieb-Liniger model at T{$>$}0. Our results demonstrate that the main contribution to the spectral widths stems from the dynamics of the interaction-induced excitations in the gas, which cannot be described by the Luttinger liquid theory.},

  abstract = {We consider the quantum XY model and study the effects of interacting perturbations on the time evolution of the von Neumann and R\textbackslash 'enyi entropies of spin blocks after global quenches. We show that the entropies are sensitive to perturbations that break hidden symmetries behind the integrability of the model. At times much larger than the characteristic time of the well-known linear increase of the entropies, we identify a time window characterized by a novel linear growth followed by saturation. The typical time of the phenomenon is inversely proportional to the perturbation strength and the behavior is trigger off by the extinction of an infinite number of local conservation laws following a non-abelian algebra. The universality of the crossover is revealed by a semi-classical picture that captures the leading behavior of the entropies. We check our theoretical predictions against iTEBD simulations. The good agreement between theory and numerics substantiates the method developed in [Bertini and Fagotti, J. Stat. Mech. (2015) P07012] for investigating a pre-relaxation limit in weakly interacting models.},

Namely, rather than restricting to standard coarse-grained measurements, we consider\$\textbackslash backslash\$n observers able to master any possible quantum measurement \textemdash a scenario that might be relevant at\$\textbackslash backslash\$n nanoscopic scales. In this setting, we focus on quantum systems of coupled harmonic oscillators and\$\textbackslash backslash\$n study the question of whether the temperature is an intensive quantity, in the sense that a block of\$\textbackslash backslash\$n a thermal state can be approximated by an effective thermal state at the same temperature as the\$\textbackslash backslash\$n whole system. Using the quantum fidelity as figure of merit, we identify instances in which this\$\textbackslash backslash\$n approximation is not valid, as the block state and the reference thermal state are distinguishable\$\textbackslash backslash\$n for refined measurements. Actually, there are situations in which this distinguishability even\$\textbackslash backslash\$n increases with the block size. However, we also show that the two states do become less\$\textbackslash backslash\$n distinguishable with the block size for coarse-grained measurements \textemdash thus recovering the standard\$\textbackslash backslash\$n picture. We then go further and construct an effective thermal state which provides a good\$\textbackslash backslash\$n approximation of the block state for any observables and sizes.

In a classical system the temperature behaves as an intensive magnitude, above a certain block size, regardless of the actual value of the temperature itself. However, a deviation from this behavior is expected in quantum systems. In particular, we see that under some conditions the description of the blocks as thermal states with the same global temperature as the whole chain fails. We analyze this issue by employing the quantum fidelity as a figure of merit, singling out in detail the departure from the classical behavior. As it may be expected, we see that quantum features are more prominent at low temperatures and are affected by the presence of zero-temperature quantum phase transitions. Interestingly, we show that the blocks can be considered indeed as thermal states with a high fidelity, provided an effective local temperature is properly identified. Such a result may originate from typical properties of reduced subsystems of energy-constrained Hilbert spaces. Finally, the relation between local and global temperatures is analyzed as a function of the size of the blocks and the system parameters.},

  abstract = {In this Letter, we present a result on the nonequilibrium dynamics causing equilibration and Gaussification of quadratic noninteracting fermionic Hamiltonians. Specifically, based on two basic assumptions\textemdash clustering of correlations in the initial state and the Hamiltonian exhibiting delocalizing transport\textemdash we prove that non-Gaussian initial states become locally indistinguishable from fermionic Gaussian states after a short and well controlled time. This relaxation dynamics is governed by a power-law independent of the system size. Our argument is general enough to allow for pure and mixed initial states, including thermal and ground states of interacting Hamiltonians on large classes of lattices as well as certain spin systems. The argument gives rise to rigorously proven instances of a convergence to a generalized Gibbs ensemble. Our results allow us to develop an intuition of equilibration that is expected to be more generally valid and relates to current experiments of cold atoms in optical lattices.},

  abstract = {Even after almost a century, the foundations of quantum statistical mechanics are still not completely understood. In this work, we provide a precise account on these foundations for a class of systems of paradigmatic importance that appear frequently as mean-field models in condensed matter physics, namely non-interacting lattice models of fermions (with straightforward extension to bosons). We demonstrate that already the translation invariance of the Hamiltonian governing the dynamics and a finite correlation length of the possibly non-Gaussian initial state provide sufficient structure to make mathematically precise statements about the equilibration of the system towards a generalized Gibbs ensemble, even for highly non-translation invariant initial states far from ground states of non-interacting models. Whenever these are given, the system will equilibrate rapidly according to a power-law in time as long as there are no long-wavelength dislocations in the initial second moments that would render the system resilient to relaxation. Our proof technique is rooted in the machinery of Kusmin-Landau bounds. Subsequently, we numerically illustrate our analytical findings through a quench scenario with an initial state corresponding to an Anderson insulator observing power-law equilibration. We consider some possibilities for realizing distinct instances of generalized Gibbs ensembles in optical lattice-based quantum simulators and studying their stability in the presence of interactions.},

We also address initial state independence, absence of thermalisation, and many-body localisation. We elucidate the role played by key concepts for these phenomena, such as Lieb\textendash Robinson bounds, entanglement growth, typicality arguments, quantum maximum entropy principles and the generalised Gibbs ensembles, and quantum (non-)integrability.

We also address initial state independence, absence of thermalisation, and many-body localisation. We elucidate the role played by key concepts for these phenomena, such as Lieb-Robinson bounds, entanglement growth, typicality arguments, quantum maximum entropy principles and the generalised Gibbs ensembles, and quantum (non-)integrability.

In this work, we introduce the total correlations, a concept from quantum information theory capturing multi-partite correlations, to the study of this phenomenon. We demonstrate that the total correlations of the diagonal ensemble provides a meaningful diagnostic tool to pin-down, probe, and better understand the MBL transition and ergodicity breaking in quantum systems. In particular, we show that the total correlations has sub-linear dependence on the system size in delocalized, ergodic phases, whereas we find that it scales extensively in the localized phase developing a pronounced peak at the transition. We exemplify the power of our approach by means of an exact diagonalization study of a Heisenberg spin chain in a disordered field.},

A key challenge is the scarcity of experimental tools for the characterization of complex transient states. We used measurements of full quantum mechanical probability distributions of matter-wave interference to study the relaxation dynamics of a coherently split one-dimensional Bose gas and obtained comprehensive information about the dynamical states of the system. After an initial rapid evolution, the full distributions reveal the approach toward a thermal-like steady state characterized by an effective temperature that is independent from the initial equilibrium temperature of the system before the splitting process. We conjecture that this state can be described through a generalized Gibbs ensemble and associate it with prethermalization. Two halves of a split ultracold gas of rubidium atoms retain memory of the initial state for an extended time.

  abstract = {Fermion Behavior in an Optical Lattice Due to their extreme tunability, optical lattices loaded with fermions and bosons are expected to act as quantum simulators, answering complicated many-body physics questions beyond the reach of theory and computation. Some of these many-body states, such as the Mott insulator and the superfluid, have been achieved in bosonic optical lattices by simply changing the characteristic depth of the lattice potential wells. Now, Hackerm\"uller et al. (p. 1621) describe an unusual effect in an optical lattice loaded with fermions: When the strength of the attraction between the fermions is increased adiabatically, instead of contracting, the gas expands in order to preserve entropy. The interplay of thermodynamics and quantum correlations can give rise to counterintuitive phenomena in many-body systems. We report on an isentropic effect in a spin mixture of attractively interacting fermionic atoms in an optical lattice. As we adiabatically increase the attraction between the atoms, we observe that the gas expands instead of contracting. This unexpected behavior demonstrates the crucial role of the lattice potential in the thermodynamics of the fermionic Hubbard model. Thermodynamic effects cause an ultracold potassium gas to expand unexpectedly when the attraction between atoms is increased.

In this Letter, we show that for translation invariant systems, simultaneous eigenstates of energy and momentum with an eigenvalue that is separated from the rest of the spectrum in that momentum sector can be arbitrarily well approximated by building a momentum superposition of a local operator acting on the ground state. The error satisfies an exponential bound in the size of the support of the local operator, with a rate determined by the gap below and above the targeted eigenvalue. We show this explicitly for the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model and discuss generalizations and applications of our result.},

In particular, the theory of matrix Lie groups and their Lie algebras is developed using only linear algebra, and more motivation and intuition for proofs is provided than in most classic texts on the subject.In addition to its accessible treatment of the basic theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras, the book is also noteworthy for including:a treatment of the Baker\textendash Campbell\textendash Hausdorff formula and its use in place of the Frobenius theorem to establish deeper results about the relationship between Lie groups and Lie algebrasmotivation for the machinery of roots, weights and the Weyl group via a concrete and detailed exposition of the representation theory of sl(3;C)an unconventional definition of semisimplicity that allows for a rapid development of the structure theory of semisimple Lie algebrasa self-contained construction of the representations of compact groups, independent of Lie-algebraic argumentsThe second edition of Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations contains many substantial improvements and additions, among them: an entirely new part devoted to the structure and representation theory of compact Lie groups; a complete derivation of the main properties of root systems; the construction of finite-dimensional representations of semisimple Lie algebras has been elaborated; a treatment of universal enveloping algebras, including a proof of the Poincar\'e\textendash Birkhoff\textendash Witt theorem and the existence of Verma modules; complete proofs of the Weyl character formula, the Weyl dimension formula and the Kostant multiplicity formula.Review of the first edition:This is an excellent book.

We prove that, if two observables anticommute with each other at large distance, then the nonvanishing spectral gap implies exponential decay of the corresponding correlation. When two observables commute with each other at large distance, the connected correlation function decays exponentially under the gap assumption. If the observables behave as a vector under the U(1) rotation of a global symmetry of the system, we use previous results on the large distance decay of the correlation function to show the stronger statement that the correlation function itself, rather than just the connected correlation function, decays exponentially under the gap assumption on a lattice with a certain self-similarity in (fractal) dimensions D{$<$}2. In particular, if the system is translationally invariant in one of the spatial directions, then this self-similarity condition is automatically satisfied. We also treat systems with long-range, power-law decaying interactions.},

  abstract = {Purification is a tool that allows to represent mixed quantum states as pure states on enlarged Hilbert spaces. A purification of a given state is not unique and its entanglement strongly depends on the particular choice made. Moreover, in one-dimensional systems, the amount of entanglement is linked to how efficiently the purified state can be represented using matrix-product states (MPS). We introduce an MPS based method that allows to find the minimally entangled representation by iteratively minimizing the second Renyi entropy. First, we consider the thermofield double purification and show that its entanglement can be strongly reduced especially at low temperatures. Second, we show that a slowdown of the entanglement growth following a quench of an infinite temperature state is possible.}

For strongly interacting systems, however, the locality of temperature breaks down. We study the possibility of associating an effective thermal state to subsystems of infinite chains of interacting spin particles of arbitrary finite dimension. We study the effect of correlations and criticality in the definition of this effective thermal state and discuss the possible implications for the classical simulation of thermal quantum systems.},

Here we consider some special problems that arise when the microscopic model is taken to be relativistic quantum field theory. These problems are associated with the existence of an infinite number of degrees of freedom per unit volume. Because of these the microscopic entropy can, and typically does, diverge for sharply localized states. However, the difference in the entropy between two such states is better behaved, and for most purposes it is the useful quantity to consider. In particular, a renormalized entropy can be defined as the entropy relative to the ground state. We make these remarks quantitative and precise in a simple model situation: the states of a conformal quantum field theory excited by a moving mirror. From this work, we attempt to draw some lessons concerning the ``information problem'' in black hole physics.},

But the essence of quantum formalism\textemdash entanglement, recognized by Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen, and Schr\"odinger\textemdash waited over 70years to enter laboratories as a new resource as real as energy. This holistic property of compound quantum systems, which involves nonclassical correlations between subsystems, has potential for many quantum processes, including canonical ones: quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation, and dense coding. However, it appears that this new resource is complex and difficult to detect. Although it is usually fragile to the environment, it is robust against conceptual and mathematical tools, the task of which is to decipher its rich structure. This article reviews basic aspects of entanglement including its characterization, detection, distillation, and quantification. In particular, various manifestations of entanglement via Bell inequalities, entropic inequalities, entanglement witnesses, and quantum cryptography are discussed, and some interrelations are pointed out. The basic role of entanglement in quantum communication within a distant laboratory paradigm is stressed, and some peculiarities such as the irreversibility of entanglement manipulations are also discussed including its extremal form\textemdash the bound entanglement phenomenon. The basic role of entanglement witnesses in detection of entanglement is emphasized.},

The book introduces these two well-known but very different ideas and removes the limitations by unifying them to one parameter-free theory of an optimal reinforcement learning agent embedded in an arbitrary unknown environment. Most if not all AI problems can easily be formulated within this theory, which reduces the conceptual problems to pure computational ones. Considered problem classes include sequence prediction, strategic games, function minimization, reinforcement and supervised learning. The discussion includes formal definitions of intelligence order relations, the horizon problem and relations to other approaches to AI. One intention of this book is to excite a broader AI audience about abstract algorithmic information theory concepts, and conversely to inform theorists about exciting applications to AI.},

Here we solve this long-standing problem for the case of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain by explicitly constructing a GGE which uniquely fixes the macrostate describing the stationary behavior after a general quantum quench. A crucial ingredient in our method, which readily generalizes to other integrable models, are recently discovered quasilocal charges. As a test, we reproduce the exact postquench steady state of the N\'eel quench problem obtained previously by means of the Quench Action method.},

A preliminary discussion is given of the second law of thermodynamics and of a certain class of irreversible processes, in an approximation equivalent to that of the semiclassical theory of radiation.\$\textbackslash backslash\$nIt is shown that a density matrix does not in general contain all the information about a system that is relevant for predicting its behavior. In the case of a system perturbed by random fluctuating fields, the density matrix cannot satisfy any differential equation because {$\rho\dot$}(t) does not depend only on {$\rho$}(t), but also on past conditions The rigorous theory involves stochastic equations in the type {$\rho$}(t)=G(t, 0){$\rho$}(0), where the operator G is a functional of conditions during the entire interval (0\textrightarrow t). Therefore a general theory of irreversible processes cannot be based on differential rate equations corresponding to time-proportional transition probabilities. However, such equations often represent useful approximations.},

  title = {Comment on '{{Reasonable}} Fermionic Quantum Information Theories Require Relativity'},
  author = {Johansson, Markus},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {In [N. Friis, New J. Phys. 18, 033014 (2016)] the non-relativistic description of fermions is considered and in particular the role of the parity superselection rule in relation to the characterization of entanglement. An argument based on the spin-statistics connection is presented as a physical motivation for the parity superselec-tion rule. Since the spin statistics connection was derived in the context of relativistic quantum mechanics it is argued that the inclusion of the parity superselection rule is motivated by Lorentz invariance. Based on this it is further argued that fermionic Quantum Information theory and the theory of special relativity are conceptually inseparable. In this comment a different, and well known, motivation for the parity superselection rule is given that does not rely on arguments from relativistic quantum mechanics, but instead uses the assumptions that the laws of physics are the same for different observers and the no-signalling principle. Fermions exist naturally in the context of relativistic quan-tum mechanics as solutions to the relativistic Dirac equation [1]. It therefore makes sense to understand the properties of fermionic systems in a relativistic context. However, non-relativistic descriptions of fermions are commonly used in cir-cumstances where relativistic effects are negligible. A necessary property of the description of fermions is that there cannot exist a coherent superposition of an even and odd number of fermions. This restriction is called the parity su-perselection rule [2, 3]. Historically it was first formalised by Wick, Wightman, and Wigner [2] and is necessary for the consistency of relativistic quantum theory, i.e., it is a conse-quence of the postulates of quantum mechanics in conjunc-tion with the principles of special relativity (See e.g. Ref. [4]). One way to motivate the parity superselection rule (SSR) is via the spin-statistics connection [5\textendash 7]. The spin statistics connection makes use of Lorentz invariance and implies that fermions have half-integer spin. The transformation proper-ties of spinors then imply that a coherent superposition of an even and an odd number of fermions is not invariant under a 2{$\pi$} spatial rotation of the system [3]. From the above argument one may be led to believe that the Lorentz invariance of special relativity is a crucial assumption that is needed to motivate the parity SSR. However, in a non-relativistic context the parity SSR can also be derived from the assumption that the laws of physics are the same to all dif-ferent observers and the microcausality principle. In the non-relativistic setting the microcausality principle (See e.g. Refs. [8, 9]) states that simultaneous physical operations in disjoint regions of space commute. If the Hilbert space of the the-ory is separable, i.e., if it has a countable orthonormal basis, the microcausality principle is equivalent to the no-signalling principle [10]. The no-signalling principle states that an ob-server can not instantly change the outcome statistics of an experiment performed by another distant observer. Separability of the Hilbert space of a quantum system is a part of the postulates of quantum mechanics as formulated by Dirac [1] and von Neumann [11]. In particular, the Hilbert space of n fermionic modes, considered in Ref. [12], is sepa-rable for any natural number n. Therefore, no-signalling and microcausality are equivalent in this context. The equivalence of the microcausality principle and the no-signalling principle, for separable Hilbert spaces, can be un-derstood in the following way. If an observable O A of an observer A does not commute with an observable O B of ob-server B it follows that O A and O B do not have a common basis of eigenstates. Thus, at least one eigenspace S of O A has no basis that is a set of eigenstates of O B . Therefore, there exist an eigenstate |{$\psi$} A {$\in$} S which has a nonzero pro-jection onto an eigenvector |{$\psi$} B of O B which does not be-long to S. If A and B prepare the state of their shared system to be |{$\psi$} A , it follows that A would find the measurement out-come corresponding to S with certainty upon performing the measurement. However, if B performs the measurement cor-responding to O B the state of the system will be reduced to an eigenstate of O B and by assumption there is thus a nonzero probability that it is reduced to |{$\psi$} B which is not in S. There-fore, if B performs the measurement before A the measure-ment statistics of A changes and A does no longer see the outcome corresponding to S with certainty. Thus, B can in-stantly change the outcome statistics of A by performing a measurement. If on the other hand [O A , O B ] = 0 it follows that O A and O B have a common eigenbasis and therefore ev-ery eigenspace of O A has a basis of eigenstates of O B . Then B cannot change the outcome statistics of A. To understand the role of the no-signalling principle and the principle that the laws of physics are the same to different ob-servers in the non-relativistic description of fermions we first review the defining properties of non-relativistic fermionic quantum theory. In such a theory all operators can be de-scribed as algebraic combinations of the creation and annihi-lation operators, a},

The Hubbard model, which encompasses the essential physics of the Mott insulator, can be realized with quantum gases trapped in an optical lattice. Therefore, experimental tools developed in atomic physics can be used to study this regime. However, an atomic Mott insulator has so far been realized only with a gas of bosons, which lack the rich and peculiar nature of fermions. The authors report the formation of a Mott insulator of a repulsively interacting two-component Fermi gas in an optical lattice.

These lectures focus on the idea of a highest weight representation, which goes through four different incarnations.The first is the canonical commutation relations of the infinite dimensional Heisenberg Algebra (= oscillator algebra). The second is the highest weight representations of the Lie algebra g{$\mathscr{l}\infty$} of infinite matrices, along with their applications to the theory of soliton equations, discovered by Sato and Date, Jimbo, Kashiwara and Miwa. The third is the unitary highest weight representations of the current (= affine Kac-Moody) algebras. These Lie algebras appear in the lectures in connection to the Sugawara construction, which is the main tool in the study of the fourth incarnation of the main idea, the theory of the highest weight representations of the Virasoro algebra. In particular, the book provides a complete proof of the Kac determinant formula, the key result in representation theory of the Virasoro algebra.The second edition of this book incorporates, as its first part, the largely unchanged text of the first edition, while its second part is the collection of lectures on vertex algebras, delivered by Professor Kac at the TIFR in January 2003. The basic idea of these lectures was to demonstrate how the key notions of the theory of vertex algebras -- such as quantum fields, their normal ordered product and lambda-bracket, energy-momentum field and conformal weight, untwisted and twisted representations -- simplify and clarify the constructions of the first edition of the book.This book should be very useful for both mathematicians and physicists. To mathematicians, it illustrates the interaction of the key ideas of the representation theory of infinite dimensional Lie algebras and of the theory of vertex algebras; and to physicists, these theories are turning into an important component of such domains of theoretical physics as soliton theory, conformal field theory, the theory of two-dimensional statistical models, and string theory.},

The recent observations of Bose\textendash Einstein condensation have shown dramatically the potential of evaporative cooling. Through evaporative cooling, phase-space density could be increased by six orders of magnitude in these experiments. In such experiments, evaporative cooling was used to reach temperature and densities that are unprecedented for trapped atoms and greatly exceeded what had been reached before by laser cooling. Laser cooling has recently broken the recoil limit in three dimensions (3D) and reached extremely cold temperatures of 3 nK in 1D. However, none of these optical sub-recoil techniques has been realized so far at high densities. The current density limitations are caused by the absorption of light, radiation trapping, and excited state collisions. An often-mentioned disadvantage of evaporative cooling is the loss of atoms. However, as discussed in the chapter, the efficiency of evaporative cooling is quite high.},

By changing the trap intensities, and hence the atomic interaction strength, the atoms can be made to act either like a Bose-Einstein condensate or like a TG gas. We measure the total 1D energy and the length of the gas. With no free parameters and over a wide range of coupling strengths, our data fit the exact solution for the ground state of a 1D Bose gas. Varying the interaction strength between bosons confined in one dimension can make them behave like fermions, confirming theory.

  month = apr,
  abstract = {Quantum many-body systems out of equilibrium pose some of the most intriguing questions in physics. Unfortunately, numerically keeping track of time evolution of states under Hamiltonian dynamics constitutes a severe challenge for all known methods. Prominently, tensor network methods are marred by an entanglement blowup, which allows to simulate systems following global quenches only to constant time. In this work, we present a scheme that allows to significantly extend the simulation time for interacting fermionic or equivalent spin systems. In the past when keeping track of evolution in one-dimensional real space, the subspace parametrised by real-space matrix product states satisfying area laws - often dubbed the "physical corner" of Hilbert space - was chosen as variational set. In contrast, if the manifold containing both tensor network states and fermionic mode transformations is chosen, significantly longer times can be achieved. We argue and our results suggest that in many cases it is genuine correlations between modes that is the actual limiting factor: The system at hand is for intermediate times contained in the "physical corner", but a different one than what is commonly assumed.},

  abstract = {The connection between the non-equilibrium dynamics of isolated quantum many-body systems and statistical mechanics is a fundamental open question. It is generally believed that the unitary quantum evolution of a sufficiently complex system leads to an apparent maximum-entropy state that can be described by thermodynamical ensembles. However, conventional ensembles fail to describe the large class of systems that exhibit non-trivial conserved quantities. Instead, generalized ensembles have been predicted to maximize entropy in these systems. In our experiments we explicitly show that a degenerate one-dimensional Bose gas relaxes to a state that can be described by such a generalized ensemble. This is verified through a detailed study of correlation functions up to 10th order. The applicability of the generalized ensemble description for isolated quantum many-body systems points to a natural emergence of classical statistical properties from the microscopic unitary quantum evolution.},

Among the elementary applications, I explicitly work out the bounds on deterministic work extraction and formation, discuss the complete solution of the theory for a single qubit and present the irreversibility of coherence transfers. The aim is to facilitate the task of those researchers interested in engaging and contributing to this topic, presenting scope and motivation of its core assumptions and discussing the relation between the resource theory and complementary approaches.},

  abstract = {I revisit the infinite-size variant of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (iDMRG) algorithm for obtaining a fixed-point translationally invariant matrix product wavefunction in the context of one-dimensional quantum systems. A crucial ingredient of this algorithm is an efficient transformation for obtaining the matrix elements of the wavefunction as the lattice size is increased, and I introduce here a versatile transformation that is demonstrated to be much more effective than previous versions. The resulting algorithm has a surprisingly close relationship to Vidal's Time Evolving Block Decimation for infinite systems, but allows much faster convergence. Access to a translationally invariant matrix product state allows the calculation of correlation functions based on the transfer matrix, which directly gives the spectrum of all correlation lengths. I also show some advantages of the Matrix Product Operator (MPO) technique for constructing expectation values of higher moments, such as the exact variance \${$<$}(H-E)\^2{$>\$$}.},

  abstract = {Optical lattices have emerged as ideal simulators for Hubbard models of strongly correlated materials, such as the high-temperature superconducting cuprates. In optical lattice experiments, microscopic parameters such as the interaction strength between particles are well known and easily tunable. Unfortunately, this benefit of using optical lattices to study Hubbard models comes with one clear disadvantage: the energy scales in atomic systems are typically nanokelvin compared with kelvin in solids, with a correspondingly miniscule temperature scale required to observe exotic phases such as d-wave superconductivity. The ultra-low temperatures necessary to reach the regime in which optical lattice simulation can have an impact\textemdash the domain in which our theoretical understanding fails\textemdash have been a barrier to progress in this field. To move forward, a concerted effort is required to develop new techniques for cooling and, by extension, techniques to measure even lower temperatures. This paper will be devoted to discussing the concepts of cooling and thermometry, fundamental sources of heat in optical lattice experiments, and a review of proposed and implemented thermometry and cooling techniques.},

  abstract = {Laser cooling is a relatively new technique that has led to insights into the behavior of atoms as well as confirming with striking detail some of the fundamental notions of quantum mechanics, such as the condensation predicted by S.N. Bose. This elegant technique, whereby atoms, molecules, and even microscopic beads of glass, are trapped in small regions of free space by beams of light and subsequently moved at will using other beams, provides a useful research tool for the study of individual atoms and clusters of atoms, for investigating the details of chemical reactions, and even for determining the physical properties of individual macromolecules such as synthetic polymers and DNA. Intended for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students who have some basic knowledge of optics and quantum mechanics, this text begins with a review of the relevant results of quantum mechanics, it then turns to the electromagnetic interactions involved in slowing and trapping atoms and ions, in both magnetic and optical traps. The concluding chapters discuss a broad range of applications, from atomic clocks and studies of collision processes to diffraction and interference of atomic beams at optical lattices and Bose-Einstein condensation.},

In this work, we give rigorous analytic results on thermalization for translation-invariant quantum lattice systems with finite-range interaction of arbitrary strength, in all cases where there is a unique equilibrium state at the corresponding temperature. We clarify the physical picture by showing that subsystems relax towards the reduction of the global Gibbs state, not the local Gibbs state, if the initial state has close to maximal population entropy and certain non-degeneracy conditions on the spectrumare satisfied.Moreover,we showthat almost all pure states with support on a small energy window are locally thermal in the sense of canonical typicality. We derive our results from a statement on equivalence of ensembles, generalizing earlier results by Lima, and give numerical and analytic finite size bounds, relating the Ising model to the finite de Finetti theorem. Furthermore, we prove that global energy eigenstates are locally close to diagonal in the local energy eigenbasis, which constitutes a part of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis that is valid regardless of the integrability of the model.},

We study this problem for the case of random unitary dynamics, representing either Hamiltonian evolution with time-dependent noise or evolution by a random quantum circuit. Our results reveal a universal structure behind noisy entanglement growth, and also provide simple new heuristics for the ``entanglement tsunami'' in Hamiltonian systems without noise. In 1D, we show that noise causes the entanglement entropy across a cut to grow according to the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. The mean entanglement grows linearly in time, while fluctuations grow like (time)1/3 and are spatially correlated over a distance {$\propto$}(time)2/3. We derive KPZ universal behavior in three complementary ways, by mapping random entanglement growth to (i) a stochastic model of a growing surface, (ii) a ``minimal cut'' picture, reminiscent of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in holography, and (iii) a hydrodynamic problem involving the dynamical spreading of operators. We demonstrate KPZ universality in 1D numerically using simulations of random unitary circuits. Importantly, the leading-order time dependence of the entropy is deterministic even in the presence of noise, allowing us to propose a simple coarse grained minimal cut picture for the entanglement growth of generic Hamiltonians, even without noise, in arbitrary dimensionality.

  abstract = {Random quantum circuits yield minimally structured models for chaotic quantum dynamics, which are able to capture, for example, universal properties of entanglement growth. We provide exact results and coarse-grained models for the spreading of operators by quantum circuits made of Haar-random unitaries. We study both 1+1D and higher dimensions and argue that the coarse-grained pictures carry over to operator spreading in generic many-body systems. In 1+1D, we demonstrate that the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) satisfies a biased diffusion equation, which gives exact results for the spatial profile of the OTOC and determines the butterfly speed vB. We find that in 1+1D, the ``front'' of the OTOC broadens diffusively, with a width scaling in time as t1/2. We address fluctuations in the OTOC between different realizations of the random circuit, arguing that they are negligible in comparison to the broadening of the front within a realization. Turning to higher dimensions, we show that the averaged OTOC can be understood exactly via a remarkable correspondence with a purely classical droplet growth problem. This implies that the width of the front of the averaged OTOC scales as t1/3 in 2+1D and as t0.240 in 3+1D (exponents of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class). We support our analytic argument with simulations in 2+1D. We point out that, in two or higher spatial dimensions, the shape of the spreading operator at late times is affected by underlying lattice symmetries and, in general, is not spherical. However, when full spatial rotational symmetry is present in 2+1D, our mapping implies an exact asymptotic form for the OTOC, in terms of the Tracy-Widom distribution. For an alternative perspective on the OTOC in 1+1D, we map it to the partition function of an Ising-like statistical mechanics model. As a result of special structure arising from unitarity, this partition function reduces to a random walk calculation which can be performed exactly. We also use this mapping to give exact results for entanglement growth in 1+1D circuits.},

For a generic global quench the shape of in the low momentum limit directly gives the exponent for the power law decay to the effective steady state. As an example we compute the time evolution of the static density-density correlation in the interacting Lieb-Liniger gas after a quench from a Bose-Einstein condensate. This shows an approach to equilibrium with power law t -3 which turns out to be independent of the post-quench interaction and of the considered observable. \textcopyright{} 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

As a main ingredient, we introduce the superposed multioptimization method, which allows an efficient optimization of exponentially many MPS of different lengths at different sites all in one step. Here, the algorithm becomes protected against position-dependent effects as caused by spontaneously broken translational invariance. So far, these have been a major obstacle to convergence for the iMPS algorithm if no prior knowledge of the system's translational symmetry was accessible. Further, we investigate some more general methods to speed up calculations and improve convergence, which might be partially interesting in a much broader context, too. As a more special problem, we also look into translational invariant states close to an invariance-breaking phase transition and show how to avoid convergence into wrong local minima for such systems. Finally, we apply these methods to polar bosons with long-range interactions. We calculate several detailed Devil's staircases with the corresponding phase diagrams and investigate some supersolid properties.},

  abstract = {The non-equilibrium approach to correlated electron systems is often based on the paradigm that different degrees of freedom interact on different timescales. In this context, photo-excitation is treated as an impulsive injection of electronic energy that is transferred to other degrees of freedom only at later times. Here, by studying the ultrafast dynamics of quasi-particles in an archetypal strongly correlated charge-transfer insulator (La2CuO(4+{$\delta$})), we show that the interaction between electrons and bosons manifests itself directly in the photo-excitation processes of a correlated material. With the aid of a general theoretical framework (Hubbard-Holstein Hamiltonian), we reveal that sub-gap excitation pilots the formation of itinerant quasi-particles, which are suddenly dressed by an ultrafast reaction of the bosonic field.},

We then observe that these states can be rederived through a simple variational ansatz making no reference to a renormalization construction. The method is tested on the spin-1 Heisenberg model.},

Here, we explore the dependence of entanglement on time-dependent single-particle basis transformations in fermionic quantum many-body systems, thus aiming at isolating single-particle sources of entanglement growth in quench dynamics. Using exact diagonalization methods, for paradigmatic nonintegrable models we compare to the standard real-space cut various physically motivated bipartitions. Moreover, we search for a minimal entanglement basis using local optimization algorithms, which at short to intermediate postquench times yields a significant reduction of entanglement beyond a dynamical Hartree-Fock solution. In the long-time limit, we identify an asymptotic universality of entanglement for weakly interacting systems, as well as a crossover from dominant real-space to momentum-space entanglement in Hubbard models undergoing an interaction quench. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our findings for the development of tensor-network-based algorithms for quantum dynamics.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen an enormously revived interest in the study of thermodynamic notions in the quantum regime. This applies both to the study of notions of work extraction in thermal machines in the quantum regime, as well as to questions of equilibration and thermalisation of interacting quantum many-body systems as such. In this work we bring together these two lines of research by studying work extraction in a closed system that undergoes a sequence of quenches and equilibration steps concomitant with free evolutions. In this way, we incorporate an important insight from the study of the dynamics of quantum many body systems: the evolution of closed systems is expected to be well described, for relevant observables and most times, by a suitable equilibrium state. We will consider three kinds of equilibration, namely to (i) the time averaged state, (ii) the Gibbs ensemble and (iii) the generalised Gibbs ensemble (GGE), reflecting further constants of motion in integrable models. For each effective description, we investigate notions of entropy production, the validity of the minimal work principle and properties of optimal work extraction protocols. While we keep the discussion general, much room is dedicated to the discussion of paradigmatic non-interacting fermionic quantum many-body systems, for which we identify significant differences with respect to the role of the minimal work principle. Our work not only has implications for experiments with cold atoms, but also can be viewed as suggesting a mindset for quantum thermodynamics where the role of the external heat baths is instead played by the system itself, with its internal degrees of freedom bringing coarse-grained observables to equilibrium.},

For the ground state of the d-dimensional cubic harmonic lattice we establish a strict relationship between the surface area of a distinguished hypercube and the degree of entanglement between the hypercube and the rest of the lattice analytically, without resorting to numerical means. We outline extensions of these results to longer ranged interactions, finite temperatures, and for classical correlations in classical harmonic lattice systems. These findings further suggest that the tools of quantum information science may help in establishing results in quantum field theory that were previously less accessible.},

  abstract = {Statistical mechanics is one of the most successful areas of physics. Yet, almost 150 years since its inception, its foundations and basic postulates are still the subject of debate. Here we suggest that the main postulate of statistical mechanics, the equal a priori probability postulate, should be abandoned as misleading and unnecessary. We argue that it should be replaced by a general canonical principle, whose physical content is fundamentally different from the postulate it replaces: it refers to individual states, rather than to ensemble or time averages. Furthermore, whereas the original postulate is an unprovable assumption, the principle we propose is mathematically proven. The key element in this proof is the quantum entanglement between the system and its environment. Our approach separates the issue of finding the canonical state from finding out how close a system is to it, allowing us to go even beyond the usual boltzmannian situation.},

  abstract = {We revisit the question of whether and how the steady states arising after non-equilibrium time evolution in integrable models (and in particular in the XXZ spin chain) can be described by the so-called generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). Whereas it is known that the micro-canonical ensemble built on a complete set of charges correctly describes the long-time limit of local observables, it has been shown recently by Ilievski et al that the corresponding canonical ensemble is not well defined, and instead a dierent canonical ensemble was proposed in terms of particle occupation number operators. Here we provide an alternative construction by considering truncated GGEs (tGGEs) that include only a finite number of local and quasi-local conserved operators. It is shown that the tGGEs can approximate the steady states with arbitrary precision, i.e. all physical observables are exactly reproduced in the infinite truncation limit. We trace back the problems encountered in defining an untruncated GGE to the dependence of the associated Lagrange multipliers on the truncation index. Conversely, we show that this problem may be circumvented by considering a new set of (quasi)local charges which are linear combinations of the standard ones, and whose associated Lagrange multipliers are well-defined state functions.},

  abstract = {The recognition that large classes of quantum many-body systems have limited -- or efficiently representable -- entanglement in the ground and low-lying excited states led to dramatic advances in their numerical simulation via so-called tensor networks. However, global dynamics elevates many particles into excited states, and can lead to macroscopic entanglement (seen both experimentally and theoretically) and the failure of tensor networks. Here, we show that for quantum transport -- one of the most important cases of this failure -- the fundamental issue is the canonical basis in which the scenario is cast: When particles flow through an interface, they scatter, generating a "bit" of entanglement between spatial regions with each event. The frequency basis naturally captures that -- in the long time limit and in the absence of an inelastic event -- particles tend to flow from a state with one frequency to a state of identical frequency. Recognizing this natural structure yields a striking -- exponential in some cases -- increase in simulation efficiency, greatly extending the attainable spatial and time scales. This approach enables the mapping of the conductance diagram of the paradigmatic Anderson impurity problem. The concepts here broaden the scope of tensor network simulation into hitherto inaccessible classes of non-equilibrium many-body problems.},

  abstract = {Tensor network is a fundamental mathematical tool with a huge range of applications in physics, such as condensed matter physics, statistic physics, high energy physics, and quantum information sciences. This open access book aims to explain the tensor network contraction approaches in a systematic way, from the basic definitions to the important applications. This book is also useful to those who apply tensor networks in areas beyond physics, such as machine learning and the big-data analysis. Tensor network originates from the numerical renormalization group approach proposed by K. G. Wilson in 1975. Through a rapid development in the last two decades, tensor network has become a powerful numerical tool that can efficiently simulate a wide range of scientific problems, with particular success in quantum many-body physics. Varieties of tensor network algorithms have been proposed for different problems. However, the connections among different algorithms are not well discussed or reviewed. To fill this gap, this book explains the fundamental concepts and basic ideas that connect and/or unify different strategies of the tensor network contraction algorithms. In addition, some of the recent progresses in dealing with tensor decomposition techniques and quantum simulations are also represented in this book to help the readers to better understand tensor network. This open access book is intended for graduated students, but can also be used as a professional book for researchers in the related fields. To understand most of the contents in the book, only basic knowledge of quantum mechanics and linear algebra is required. In order to fully understand some advanced parts, the reader will need to be familiar with notion of condensed matter physics and quantum information, that however are not necessary to understand the main parts of the book. This book is a good source for non-specialists on quantum physics to understand tensor network algorithms and the related mathematics.},

  abstract = {The classical low rank approximation problem is: given a matrix A, find a rank-k matrix B such that the Frobenius norm of A - B is minimized. It can be solved efficiently using, for instance, the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). If one allows randomization and approximation, it can be solved in time proportional to the number of non-zero entries of A with high probability. Inspired by practical applications, we consider a weighted version of low rank approximation: for a non-negative weight matrix W we seek to minimize {$\sum$}i, j (Wi, j {$\cdot$} (Ai,j - Bi,j))2. The classical problem is a special case of this problem when all weights are 1. Weighted low rank approximation is known to be NP-hard, so we are interested in a meaningful parametrization that would allow efficient algorithms. In this paper we present several efficient algorithms for the case of small k and under the assumption that the weight matrix W is of low rank, or has a small number of distinct columns. An important feature of our algorithms is that they do not assume anything about the matrix A. We also obtain lower bounds that show that our algorithms are nearly optimal in these parameters. We give several applications in which these parameters are small. To the best of our knowledge, the present paper is the first to provide algorithms for the weighted low rank approximation problem with provable guarantees. Perhaps even more importantly, our algorithms proceed via a new technique, which we call ``guess the sketch''. The technique turns out to be general enough to give solutions to several other fundamental problems: adversarial matrix completion, weighted non-negative matrix factorization and tensor completion.},

Further, a natural extension of the Gibbs ensemble to integrable systems results in a theory that is able to predict the mean values of physical observables after relaxation. Finally, we show that our generalized equilibrium carries more memory of the initial conditions than the usual thermodynamic one.

Very recently, however, meaningful experimental studies of the problem have finally become possible, stimulating theoretical interest as well. Progress in this field is perhaps most urgently needed in the foundations of quantum statistical mechanics. This is so because in generic isolated systems, one expects nonequilibrium dynamics on its own to result in thermalization: a relaxation to states where the values of macroscopic quantities are stationary, universal with respect to widely differing initial conditions, and predictable through the time-tested recipe of statistical mechanics. However, it is not obvious what feature of many-body quantum mechanics makes quantum thermalization possible, in a sense analogous to that in which dynamical chaos makes classical thermalization possible. For example, dynamical chaos itself cannot occur in an isolated quantum system, where time evolution is linear and the spectrum is discrete. Underscoring that new rules could apply in this case, some recent studies even suggested that statistical mechanics may give wrong predictions for the outcomes of relaxation in such systems. Here we demonstrate that an isolated generic quantum many-body system does in fact relax to a state well-described by the standard statistical mechanical prescription. Moreover, we show that time evolution itself plays a merely auxiliary role in relaxation and that thermalization happens instead at the level of individual eigenstates, as first proposed by J.M. Deutsch and M. Srednicki. A striking consequence of this eigenstate thermalization scenario is that the knowledge of a single many-body eigenstate suffices to compute thermal averages-any eigenstate in the microcanonical energy window will do, as they all give the same result.},

  abstract = {This is a revised edition of a book which appeared close to two decades ago. Someone scrutinizing how the field has evolved in these two decades will make two interesting observations. On the one hand the observer will be struck by the staggering number of new developments in numerical linear algebra during this period. The field has evolved in all directions: theory, algorithms, software, and novel applications. Two decades ago there was essentially no publically available software for large eigenvalue problems. Today one has a flurry to choose from, and the activity in software development does not seem to be abating. A number of new algorithms appeared in this period as well. I can mention at the outset the Jacobi-Davidson algorithm and the idea of implicit restarts, both discussed in this book, but there are a few others. The most interesting development to the numerical analyst may be the expansion of the realm of eigenvalue techniques into newer and more challenging applications. Or perhaps, the more correct observation is that these applications were always there, but they were not as widely appreciated or understood by numerical analysts, or were not fully developed due to lack of software.},

It also contains several new chapters to cover important recent advances, such as the Fermi gas near unitarity, Dirac fermions, Fermi liquids and their phase transitions, quantum magnetism, and solvable models obtained from string theory. After introducing the basic theory, it moves on to a detailed description of the canonical quantum-critical phase diagram at non-zero temperatures. Finally, a variety of more complex models are explored. This book is ideal for graduate students and researchers in condensed matter physics and particle and string theory.},

We study this quantity after an interaction quench in lattice hard-core bosons and spinless fermions, and after a local chemical potential quench in a system of hard-core bosons in a superlattice potential. The former systems have a chaotic regime, where the diagonal entropy becomes equivalent to the equilibrium microcanonical entropy, coinciding with the onset of thermalization. The latter system is integrable. We show that its diagonal entropy is additive and different from the entropy of a generalized Gibbs ensemble, which has been introduced to account for the effects of conserved quantities at integrability.},

For K=2 we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a state to have a Slater number 1. We introduce a correlation measure for mixed states which can be evaluated analytically for K=2.

In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms. \textcopyright{} 2010.},

The second part surveys some more advanced topics of conformal field theory, such as the representation theory of the Virasoro algebra, conformal symmetry within string theory, an axiomatic approach to Euclidean conformally covariant quantum field theory and a mathematical interpretation of the Verlinde formula in the context of moduli spaces of holomorphic vector bundles on a Riemann surface.The substantially revised and enlarged second edition makes in particular the second part of the book more self-contained and tutorial, with many more examples given. Furthermore, two new chapters on Wightman's axioms for quantum field theory and vertex algebras broaden the survey of advanced topics.

While ground states of one-dimensional systems can be efficiently approximated using Matrix Product States (MPS), their time evolution can encode quantum computations, so that simulating the latter should be hard classically. However, one might believe that for systems with high enough symmetry, and thus insufficient parameters to encode a quantum computation, efficient classical simulation is possible. We discuss supporting evidence to the contrary: We provide a rigorous proof of the observation that a time independent local Hamiltonian can yield a linear increase of the entropy when acting on a product state in a translational invariant framework. This criterion has to be met by any classical simulation method, which in particular implies that every global approximation of the evolution requires exponential resources for any MPS based method.},

The condition follows from an exact representation of the observable as the sum of a projection onto the local conserved charges of the system and a projection onto the nonlocal ones. We show that thermalization requires that the time average of the latter part vanishes in the thermodynamic limit while time and statistical averages for the first part are identical. As an example, we use this thermalization condition to analyze exact diagonalization data for a one-dimensional spin model. We find that local correlators do thermalize in the thermodynamic limit, although we find no indications that the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis applies.},

Berry's conjecture is expected to hold only if the corresponding classical system is chaotic, and essentially states that the energy eigenfunctions behave as if they were Gaussian random variables. We review the existing evidence, and show that previously neglected effects substantially strengthen the case for Berry's conjecture. We study a rarefied hard-sphere gas as an explicit example of a many-body system which is known to be classically chaotic, and show that an energy eigenstate which obeys Berry's conjecture predicts a Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein, or Fermi-Dirac distribution for the momentum of each constituent particle, depending on whether the wave functions are taken to be nonsymmetric, completely symmetric, or completely antisymmetric functions of the positions of the particles. We call this phenomenon eigenstate thermalization. We show that a generic initial state will approach thermal equilibrium at least as fast as O({$\Elzxh$}/{$\Delta$})t-1, where {$\Delta$} is the uncertainty in the total energy of the gas. This result holds for an individual initial state; in contrast to the classical theory, no averaging over an ensemble of initial states is needed. We argue that these results constitute a sound foundation for quantum statistical mechanics., This article appears in the following collection:},

We study a rarefied hard-sphere gas as an explicit example of a many-body system which is known to be classically chaotic, and show that an energy eigenstate which obeys Berry's conjecture predicts a Maxwell\textendash Boltzmann, Bose\textendash Einstein, or Fermi\textendash Dirac distribution for the momentum of each constituent particle, depending on whether the wave functions are taken to be nonsymmetric, completely symmetric, or completely antisymmetric functions of the positions of the particles. We call this phenomenon \{\$\textbackslash backslash\$it eigenstate thermalization\}. We show that a generic initial state will approach thermal equilibrium at least as fast as \$O(\textbackslash backslashhbar/\textbackslash backslashDelta)t\^\{-1\}\$, where \$\textbackslash backslashDelta\$ is the uncertainty in the total energy of the gas. This result holds for an individual initial state; in contrast to the classical theory, no averaging over an ensemble of initial states is needed. We argue that these results constitute a new foundation for quantum statistical mechanics.},

  abstract = {This new edition of Prof. Strocchi's well received primer on rigorous aspects of symmetry breaking presents a more detailed and thorough discussion of the mechanism of symmetry breaking in classical field theory in relation with the Noether theorem. Moreover, the link between symmetry breaking without massless Goldstone bosons in Coulomb systems and in gauge theories is made more explicit in terms of the delocalized Coulomb dynamics. Furthermore, the chapter on the Higgs mechanism has been significantly expanded with a non-perturbative treatment of the Higgs phenomenon, at the basis of the standard model of particle physics, in the local and in the Coulomb gauges. Last but not least, a subject index has been added and a number of misprints have been corrected. From the reviews of the first edition: The notion of spontaneous symmetry breaking has proven extremely valuable, the problem is that most derivations are perturbative and heuristic. Yet mathematically precise versions do exist, but are not widely known. It is precisely the aim of his book to correct this unbalance. - It is remarkable to see how much material can actually be presented in a rigorous way (incidentally, many of the results presented are due to Strocchi himself), yet this is largely ignored, the original heuristic derivations being, as a rule, more popular. - At each step he strongly emphasizes the physical meaning and motivation of the various notions introduced [...] a book that fills a conspicuous gap in the literature, and does it rather well. It could also be a good basis for a graduate course in mathematical physics. It can be recommended to physicists as well and, of course, for physics/mathematics libraries. J.-P. Antoine, Physicalia 28/2, 2006 Strocchi's main emphasis is on the fact that the loss of symmetric behaviour requires both the non-symmetric ground states and the infinite extension of the system. It is written in a pleasant style at a level suitable for graduate students in theoretical physics. While mathematically proper, it is not forbidding for a physics readership; the author is always aware this subject is a branch of physics. It should make profitable reading for many theoretical physicists. L.H. Ryder, J. Phys. A, 38 (2005) 9719-9730 In these notes the author explores the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking as it arises in classical and quantum systems. Despite many accounts in popular textbooks and a widespread belief, the phenomenon is rather subtle, requires an infinite set of degrees of freedom and an advanced mathematical setting of the system under investigation. [...] The mathematically oriented graduate student will certainly benefit from this thorough, rigorous and detailed investigation. G. Roepstorff, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1075, 2006},

  abstract = {The power of matrix product states to describe infinite-size translational-invariant critical spin chains is investigated. At criticality, the accuracy with which they describe ground-state properties of a system is limited by the size {$\chi$} of the matrices that form the approximation. This limitation is quantified in terms of the scaling of the half-chain entanglement entropy. In the case of the quantum Ising model, we find S{$\sim$}16log {$\chi$} with high precision. This result can be understood as the emergence of an effective finite correlation length {$\xi\chi$} ruling all the scaling properties in the system. We produce six extra pieces of evidence for this finite-{$\chi$} scaling, namely, the scaling of the correlation length, the scaling of magnetization, the shift of the critical point, the scaling of the entanglement entropy for a finite block of spins, the existence of scaling functions, and the agreement with analogous classical results. All our computations are consistent with a scaling relation of the form {$\xi\chi\sim\chi\kappa$}, with {$\kappa$}=2 for the Ising model. In the case of the Heisenberg model, we find similar results with the value {$\kappa\sim$}1.37. We also show how finite-{$\chi$} scaling allows us to extract critical exponents. These results are obtained using the infinite time evolved block decimation algorithm which works in the thermodynamical limit and are verified to agree with density-matrix renormalization-group results and their classical analog obtained with the corner transfer-matrix renormalization group.},

  abstract = {Continuous-variable systems realized in quantum optics play a major role in quantum information processing, and it is also one of the promising candidates for a scalable quantum computer. We introduce a resource theory for continuous-variable systems relevant to universal quantum computation. In our theory, easily implementable operations---Gaussian operations combined with feed-forward---are chosen to be the free operations, making the convex hull of the Gaussian states the natural free states. Since our free operations and free states cannot perform universal quantum computation, genuine non-Gaussian states---states not in the convex hull of Gaussian states---are the necessary resource states for universal quantum computation together with free operations. We introduce a monotone to quantify the genuine non-Gaussianity of resource states, in analogy to the stabilizer theory. A direct application of our resource theory is to bound the conversion rate between genuine non-Gaussian states. Finally, we give a protocol that probabilistically distills genuine non-Gaussianity---increases the genuine non-Gaussianity of resource states---only using free operations and postselection on Gaussian measurements, where our theory gives an upper bound for the distillation rate. In particular, the same protocol allows the distillation of cubic phase states, which enable universal quantum computation when combined with free operations.},

Using an optical superlattice, we follow its dynamics in terms of quasi-local densities, currents and coherences\textemdash all showing a fast relaxation towards equilibrium values. Numerical calculations based on matrix-product states are in an excellent quantitative agreement with the experimental data. The system fulfills the promise of being a dynamical quantum simulator, in that the controlled dynamics runs for longer times than present classical algorithms can keep track of.},

The structure of the excitation spectrum is investigated without equating the matrix element of the interaction potential to a constant at an early stage, and new relationships and equations are derived. The temperature dependent problem is described by means of a statistical operator, and its relationship to that of the grand canonical ensemble is established. Simple new relationships are obtained for the correlation function.},

The Table of Contents of this treatise is given in Appendix 13. A small number of other books devoted entirely to determinants have been published in English, but they contain little if anything of importance that was not known to Muir and Metzler. A few have appeared in German and Japanese. In contrast, the shelves of every mathematics library groan under the weight of books on linear algebra, some of which contain short chapters on determinants but usually only on those aspects of the subject which are applicable to the chapters on matrices. There appears to be tacit agreement among authorities on linear algebra that determinant theory is important only as a branch of matrix theory. In sections devoted entirely to the establishment of a determinantal relation, many authors de?ne a determinant by ?rst de?ning a matrixM and then adding the words: ``Let detM be the determinant of the matrix M'' as though determinants have no separate existence. This belief has no basis in history.},

If a state passes a program it is a convex-Gaussian state and any convex-Gaussian state can be approximated with arbitrary precision by states passing the criterion. The criterion is presented in the form of a sequence of solvable semidefinite programs. It is also complementary to the one developed by de Melo, Cwiklinski and Terhal, which aims at characterizing the set of convex-Gaussian states from the outside. Here we present an explicit proof that criterion by de Melo et al. is complete, by estimating a distance between an n-extendible state, a state that passes the criterion, to the set of convex-Gaussian states.},

  abstract = {The generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) was introduced ten years ago to describe observables in isolated integrable quantum systems after equilibration. Since then, the GGE has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool to predict the outcome of the relaxation dynamics of few-body observables in a variety of integrable models, a process we call generalized thermalization. This review discusses several fundamental aspects of the GGE and generalized thermalization in integrable systems. In particular, we focus on questions such as: which observables equilibrate to the GGE predictions and who should play the role of the bath; what conserved quantities can be used to construct the GGE; what are the differences between generalized thermalization in noninteracting systems and in interacting systems mappable to noninteracting ones; why is it that the GGE works when traditional ensembles of statistical mechanics fail. Despite a lot of interest in these questions in recent years, no definite answers have been given. We review results for the XX model and for the transverse field Ising model. For the latter model, we also report original results and show that the GGE describes spin-spin correlations over the entire system. This makes apparent that there is no need to trace out a part of the system in real space for equilibration to occur and for the GGE to apply. In the past, a spectral decomposition of the weights of various statistical ensembles revealed that generalized eigenstate thermalization occurs in the XX model (hard-core bosons). Namely, eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with similar distributions of conserved quantities have similar expectation values of few-spin observables. Here we show that generalized eigenstate thermalization also occurs in the transverse field Ising model.},

  abstract = {Thermalization and scrambling are the subject of much recent study from the perspective of many-body quantum systems with locally bounded Hilbert spaces (``spin chains''), quantum field theory, and holography. We tackle this problem in 1D spin chains evolving under random local unitary circuits and prove a number of exact results on the behavior of out-of-time-ordered commutators (OTOCs) and entanglement growth in this setting. These results follow from the observation that the spreading of operators in random circuits is described by a ``hydrodynamical'' equation of motion, despite the fact that random unitary circuits do not have locally conserved quantities (e.g., no conserved energy). In this hydrodynamic picture, quantum information travels in a front with a ``butterfly velocity'' vB that is smaller than the light-cone velocity of the system, while the front itself broadens diffusively in time. The OTOC increases sharply after the arrival of the light cone, but we do not observe a prolonged exponential regime of the form {$\sim$}e{$\lambda$}L(t-x/v) for a fixed Lyapunov exponent {$\lambda$}L. We find that the diffusive broadening of the front has important consequences for entanglement growth, leading to an entanglement velocity that can be significantly smaller than the butterfly velocity. We conjecture that the hydrodynamical description applies to more generic Floquet ergodic systems, and we support this idea by verifying numerically that the diffusive broadening of the operator wavefront also holds in a more traditional nonrandom Floquet spin chain. We also compare our results to Clifford circuits, which have less rich hydrodynamics and consequently trivial OTOC behavior, but which can nevertheless exhibit linear entanglement growth and thermalization.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty relations lie at the very core of quantum mechanics, and form the cornerstone of essentially all quantum cryptographic applications. In particular, they play an important role in cryptographic protocols in the bounded-quantum-storage model, where proving the security of all existing protocols ultimately reduces to bounding such relations. Yet, very little is known about such uncertainty relations for more than two measurements. Here, we prove optimal entropic uncertainty relations for anti-commuting binary observables for the Shannon entropy, and nearly optimal relations for the collision entropy.

  abstract = {To measure an observable of a quantum mechanical system leaves it in one of its eigenstates and the result of the measurement is one of its eigenvalues. This process is shown to be a computational resource: Hermitean (N \texttimes N) matrices can be diagonalized, in principle, by performing appropriate quantum mechanical measurements. To do so, one considers the given matrix as an observable of a single spin with appropriate length s which can be measured using a generalized Stern-Gerlach apparatus. Then, each run provides one eigenvalue of the observable. As the underlying working principle is the `collapse of the wavefunction' associated with a measurement, the procedure is neither a digital nor an analogue calculation - it defines thus a new example of a quantum mechanical method of computation.},

With the guidance from the boundary and bulk modular flows we find a natural slicing of the entanglement wedge with the modular planes, which are codimension one bulk surfaces tangent to the modular flow everywhere. This gives an one-to-one correspondence between the points on the boundary interval A and the points on the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surface EA. In the same sense an arbitrary subinterval A2 of A will correspond to a subinterval E2 of EA. This fine correspondence indicates that the length of E2 captures the contribution sA(A2) from A2 to the entanglement entropy SA, hence gives the contour function for entanglement entropy. Furthermore we propose that sA(A2) in general can be written as a simple linear combination of entanglement entropies of single intervals inside A. This proposal passes several nontrivial tests.},

We show that for Poincar\'e invariant theories the physical requirements are enough to uniquely determine the PEE (or the entanglement contour) to satisfy a general formula. This is the first time we find the PEE can be uniquely determined.

General equilibration results show that equilibration is generic provided that the initial state has overlap with sufficiently many energy levels. But results not referring to typicality which show that natural initial states actually fulfill this condition are lacking. In this work, we present stringent results for equilibration for systems in which R\'enyi entanglement entropies in energy eigenstates with finite energy density are extensive for at least some, not necessarily connected, subsystems. Our results reverse the logic of common arguments, in that we derive equilibration from a weak condition akin to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which is usually attributed to thermalization in systems that are assumed to equilibrate in the first place. We put the findings into the context of studies of many-body localization and many-body scars.},

Lett. 113:140401 (2014)]. We then show that in the asymptotic limit of many copies of a state, both are given by simple single-letter formulas: the distillable coherence is given by the relative entropy of coherence (in other words, we give the relative entropy of coherence its operational interpretation), and the coherence cost by the coherence of formation, which is an optimization over convex decompositions of the state. An immediate corollary is that there exists no bound coherent state in the sense that one would need to consume coherence to create the state but no coherence could be distilled from it. Further we demonstrate that the coherence theory is generically an irreversible theory by a simple criterion that completely characterizes all reversible states.},

This counterintuitive idea which has its roots in the nonextensive nature of black-hole entropy serves as a guiding principle in the search for the fundamental laws of Planck-scale physics. In this paper we show that a similar phenomenon emerges from the established laws of classical and quantum physics: the information contained in part of a system in thermal equilibrium obeys an area law. While the maximal information per unit area depends classically only on the number of microscopic degrees of freedom, it may diverge as the inverse temperature in quantum systems. A rigorous relation between area laws and correlations is established and their explicit behavior is revealed for a large class of quantum many-body states beyond equilibrium systems.},

  abstract = {Connecting short time microscopic dynamics with long time hydrodynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems is one of the outstanding questions. In particular, it is very difficult to determine various hydrodynamic coefficients like the diffusion constant or viscosity starting from a microscopic model: exact quantum simulations are limited to either small system sizes or to short times, which are insufficient to reach asymptotic behavior. In this Letter, we show that these difficulties, at least for a particular model, can be circumvented by using the cluster truncated Wigner approximation (CTWA), which maps quantum Hamiltonian dynamics into classical Hamiltonian dynamics in auxiliary high-dimensional phase space. We apply CTWA to a XXZ next-nearest-neighbor spin 1/2 chain and find behavior consisting of short time spin relaxation which gradually crosses over to emergent diffusive behavior at long times. For a random initial state we show that CTWA correctly reproduces the whole spin spectral function. Necessary in this construction is sampling from properly fluctuating initial conditions: the Dirac mean-field (variational) ansatz, which neglects such fluctuations, leads to incorrect predictions.},

This review analyzes the basic approaches to describing the phenomena of equilibration, thermalization, and decoherence in finite quantum systems. Isolated, nonisolated, and quasi-isolated quantum systems are considered. The relations between equilibration, decoherence, and the existence of time arrow are emphasized. The possibility for the occurrence of rare events, preventing complete equilibration, are mentioned.},

In particular, we show that the Matrix Product State Transfer Matrix (MPS-TM) - a central object in the computation of static correlation functions - provides important information about the location and magnitude of the minima of the low energy dispersion relation(s) and present supporting numerical data for one-dimensional lattice and continuum models as well as two-dimensional lattice models on a cylinder. We elaborate on the peculiar structure of the MPS-TM's eigenspectrum and give several arguments for the close relation between the structure of the low energy spectrum of the system and the form of static correlation functions. Finally, we discuss how the MPS-TM connects to the exact Quantum Transfer Matrix (QTM) of the model at zero temperature. We present a renormalization group argument for obtaining finite bond dimension approximations of MPS, which allows to reinterpret variational MPS techniques (such as the Density Matrix Renormalization Group) as an application of Wilson's Numerical Renormalization Group along the virtual (imaginary time) dimension of the system.},

  abstract = {We carry out a comprehensive comparison between the exact modular Hamiltonian and the lattice version of the Bisognano-Wichmann (BW) one in one-dimensional critical quantum spin chains. As a warm-up, we first illustrate how the trace distance provides a more informative mean of comparison between reduced density matrices when compared to any other Schatten \$n\$-distance, normalized or not. In particular, as noticed in earlier works, it provides a way to bound other correlation functions in a precise manner, i.e., providing both lower and upper bounds. Additionally, we show that two close reduced density matrices, i.e. with zero trace distance for large sizes, can have very different modular Hamiltonians. This means that, in terms of describing how two states are close to each other, it is more informative to compare their reduced density matrices rather than the corresponding modular Hamiltonians. After setting this framework, we consider the ground states for infinite and periodic XX spin chain and critical Ising chain. We provide robust numerical evidence that the trace distance between the lattice BW reduced density matrix and the exact one goes to zero as \$\textbackslash ell\^\{-2\}\$ for large length of the interval \$\textbackslash ell\$. This provides strong constraints on the difference between the corresponding entanglement entropies and correlation functions. Our results indicate that discretized BW reduced density matrices reproduce exact entanglement entropies and correlation functions of local operators in the limit of large subsystem sizes. Finally, we show that the BW reduced density matrices fall short of reproducing the exact behavior of the logarithmic emptiness formation probability in the ground state of the XX spin chain.},
